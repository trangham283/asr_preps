To facilitate examining the differences among the different head
percolation schemes, there is a simple program to read in trees and
output head-annotated trees, according to the percolation scheme
provided.  It is in the SParseval directory and is called headtrees.
It is called with many of the same switches: -h headinfo -p params -l
(if list of trees).  There is only one argument, however, for a file
of trees or a list of files of trees.

This outputs labeled bracketing, so it can be a bit hard to read.  
Each non-terminal is augmented with its lexical head:
(NP^house (DT the) (NN dog) (NN house)) 
You can label any given tree with Hwa-derived heads and with Charniak-derived 
heads, and then compare.
