SParseval parse scoring tool as described in 
"SParseval: Evaluation Metrics for Parsing Speech", Roark et al., 2006

The original download link in the paper is no longer available. I got this download from 
https://nlp.stanford.edu/~mcclosky/software/Parsing/

Apparently this link is also dead since then...
