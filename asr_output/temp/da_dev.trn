i've  (2347A_0001)
as far as i'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating (2347A_0002)
and i think that comes about from there being a definite factor in the job market now (2347A_0003)
i would like (2347A_0025)
yes (2347A_0026)
i have worked outside of the home (2347A_0027)
and i was in one of those safe occupations (2347A_0028)
i was a school teacher (2347A_0031)
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career (2347A_0033)
 we (2347A_0035)
 then i stopped teaching after my husband's business was established (2347A_0036)
and we had two children (2347A_0037)
and i stayed home with those children and raise those children (2347A_0038)
and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching (2347A_0041)
which if anyone who's ever been involved in that some days it's fun (2347A_0043)
and some days you wonder why you're even bothering (2347A_0044)
cause you're fighting for your life (2347A_0046)
but i am a fighter (2347A_0049)
and i've always been a disciplinarian (2347A_0050)
 i i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply (2347A_0051)
i think they're going in by choice (2347A_0052)
yes (2347A_0055)
and and i have no problem with that (2347A_0056)
but i think the male needs to be the dominant person (2347A_0057)
and i think too many of the young professional lives in our small town of five thousand  are not letting that happen (2347A_0058)
they are very aggressive (2347A_0061)
they're  they almost have what i would call a killer rape killer be instinct (2347A_0063)
and they have to be in charge (2347A_0065)
and and i i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands (2347A_0066)
 sure (2347A_0088)
my wife had an education and could support us (2347A_0107)
and they only value i see coming out of this is that children now and and a two parents home they now actually have two parents (2347A_0108)
because i see my son's in law (2347A_0112)
i have a daughter who's a nurse (2347A_0113)
i have a daughter who's a beautician (2347A_0114)
i see my son's inlaws cooking and dropping children off at the sitter picking children up from school and and having a much better relationship with their children that my husband never did (2347A_0117)
because he left home at five thirty in the morning (2347A_0129)
he got home at six fifteen (2347A_0132)
and  (2347A_0134)
and he was asleep and his chair because he was exhausted (2347A_0135)
so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent (2347A_0137)
and i think that's an advantage (2347A_0138)
and i think it's a wonderful advantage for the young for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with her father (2347A_0152)
and and i don't think we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input (2347A_0156)
but  i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build the roads (2347A_0160)
and they have to that kind of job  to go out there and shovel let tar and and drives those big trucks (2347A_0161)
and we just recently finished a long drive through their west a little over five thousand miles (2347A_0164)
and  one point we sat down (2347A_0166)
i didn't realize that (2347A_0167)
but i said at the counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers own (2347A_0168)
and here's this young girl with the tattoos (2347A_0170)
and she has just had just driven a load of meat from minneapolis to someplace in arizona (2347A_0171)
and she'd been (2347A_0173)
and i ask her how old she was (2347A_0174)
and she was the between the age of our daughters (2347A_0175)
and she'd been driving a truck for seven years (2347A_0176)
and i thought gosh (2347A_0179)
i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble lifestyle when (2347A_0180)
i guess i'm i'm maybe victorian (2347A_0183)
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist (2347A_0184)
and that he's a very considerate person (2347A_0185)
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home (2347A_0188)
she should vote (2347A_0189)
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote (2347A_0190)
it probably doesn't work that way and our household because i have strong opinions about things too (2347A_0192)
but  i like being taken care of (2347A_0195)
like my luggage carried in my door open (2347A_0196)
i think the young women are losing that (2347A_0199)
i think that's sad (2347A_0200)
he was raised in the south (2347A_0205)
i think that's a little more condition (2347A_0207)
 sure (2347A_0220)
think a lot of my problem with the young mothers (2347A_0253)
alright (2347B_0000)
well i tend i tend to agree (2347B_0005)
 in some ways i think it's i think if anything a lot of  the changes that have occurred  (2347B_0006)
in some ways there for the better (2347B_0007)
because i think women should have a choice (2347B_0008)
and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life (2347B_0009)
by the same token and i noticed for myself because i've worked in i've not heard  (2347B_0010)
that it makes it  some of that makes life more difficult (2347B_0011)
i think when the rolls now are less defined as far as you know what  women should or should not be doing that it it can make life more difficult (2347B_0012)
they are more things to work out (2347B_0013)
i know when i was working you know you have always problems with with the child care and and with  pleasing you know your boss on a job (2347B_0014)
so you have added stress is from there (2347B_0015)
and then you still have all the things that  that you need to do at home (2347B_0016)
and that doesn't change (2347B_0017)
just because you're you're going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't  make those other things go away (2347B_0018)
and the other responsibilities are still important (2347B_0019)
so  have you have you worked outside also and  feel that it that (2347B_0021)
well how do you feel as far as  (2347B_0022)
what would be a happy medium (2347B_0023)
or what would you like to see (2347B_0024)
yeah (2347B_0029)
yes (2347B_0039)
yes (2347B_0042)
right (2347B_0045)
yeah (2347B_0048)
 i i think so (2347B_0053)
yes (2347B_0054)
yeah (2347B_0064)
well what do you think (2347B_0069)
so   (2347B_0070)
i don't know (2347B_0071)
the the one problem i guess i have (2347B_0073)
maybe it was so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is (2347B_0074)
i feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as  a job in itself (2347B_0075)
you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself (2347B_0076)
but i know when i was working (2347B_0077)
and i was an engineer so i was always with men (2347B_0078)
 and they were single many of them (2347B_0079)
i try to explain to them on my day doesn't and when i leave (2347B_0080)
i used to leave  three i keep going till eleven at night (2347B_0081)
and they had they used to look down on women that were (2347B_0084)
i bet you go home and (2347B_0085)
you know at least you get outta here (2347B_0086)
you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas (2347B_0087)
and i used to be infuriated (2347B_0089)
because they really had no idea what was involved once i got home (2347B_0091)
taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything (2347B_0092)
and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected and that being home is not a respectable opposition in society (2347B_0093)
and there's a lot of truth to that (2347B_0096)
and i don't know how you feel (2347B_0097)
i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got (2347B_0098)
but i can see what the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home (2347B_0099)
and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy (2347B_0100)
you you (2347B_0101)
once in a while you hear them say things like i wish i had the choice (2347B_0102)
i wish i was the one (2347B_0105)
i would stay home with my kids my wife would go out and (2347B_0106)
yeah (2347B_0111)
right (2347B_0115)
right (2347B_0120)
right (2347B_0122)
right (2347B_0123)
that's true (2347B_0127)
that's true (2347B_0130)
yes (2347B_0133)
right (2347B_0136)
they enjoy it (2347B_0139)
yeah (2347B_0141)
and they do enjoy it (2347B_0142)
i see that (2347B_0143)
you're right (2347B_0146)
see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children (2347B_0147)
and i think that is healthy because (2347B_0151)
right (2347B_0153)
yeah (2347B_0154)
yeah (2347B_0157)
yeah (2347B_0159)
yeah (2347B_0181)
 boy (2347B_0191)
yeah (2347B_0193)
right (2347B_0197)
well that that's true (2347B_0201)
i guess we all (2347B_0203)
all the your husband's probably been as much conditioned is you know anybody else (2347B_0204)
i guess (2347B_0208)
  yeah (2347B_0210)
and you have to i guess if the question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle wage an older man why they feel that way (2347B_0211)
and i think it gets scary for them to see change also (2347B_0212)
they've been used to being really to be honest in society in a way number one (2347B_0213)
and they come home (2347B_0214)
everything's done for them (2347B_0215)
their mail with (2347B_0218)
and i think it's frightening to them to see the rolls switching (2347B_0219)
and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear (2347B_0221)
my husband is  he's ten years older than me (2347B_0222)
and (2347B_0223)
but he has his attitudes are very much pro women pro career which is kind of interesting (2347B_0224)
he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything (2347B_0226)
and yet  he's the type that he is willing to have to take all more responsibility  if that meant you know for me to be able to   advance or go back to work or whatever (2347B_0228)
i'm kind of more (2347B_0229)
thank you (2347B_0230)
i'm kind of more middle of the road (2347B_0231)
i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work a special (2347B_0232)
there should be some a lot more part time (2347B_0233)
but i think it's  (2347B_0234)
i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think (2347B_0235)
they are downstairs (2347B_0237)
i think that's very  unfair to to children (2347B_0238)
 engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week (2347B_0239)
i refuse to work more than thirty (2347B_0243)
i was part time (2347B_0245)
and that was a rat race (2347B_0246)
but i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here (2347B_0248)
i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm travelling around and i'm away and (2347B_0249)
so i think you can have both (2347B_0250)
it's more hectic (2347B_0251)
but i think you have to put him into perspective what your kids need first and (2347B_0252)
yeah (2505A_0001)
i don't have any children (2505A_0002)
so (2505A_0003)
but  i have a lot of friends with children (2505A_0004)
and i know they spend a lot of time with them (2505A_0005)
which is good you know (2505A_0006)
yeah (2505A_0015)
have a lot of value (2505A_0016)
i love that (2505A_0017)
they have children (2505A_0019)
 that's wonderful (2505A_0024)
 that's neat (2505A_0033)
that's good you know (2505A_0035)
i like to see that (2505A_0036)
you know i have  some friends that  (2505A_0038)
first of all all the girls joined (2505A_0039)
they have two girls (2505A_0040)
one joined the girl scouts (2505A_0041)
and the other was in the brownies (2505A_0042)
and the mother got involved as a leader (2505A_0043)
and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with during nature and working with the girl scout camp here in dallas and then going out to  betty pro camp and working with the horses and stuff (2505A_0044)
and they're gone a lot (2505A_0045)
and they take (2505A_0046)
and they go away for weekends and in the wintertime leave and you know to do work with the girl scouts (2505A_0047)
i think it's neat (2505A_0048)
you know they really become very much involved in in just that one organization (2505A_0050)
which do organization can use to help too (2505A_0051)
so i i wish i could see more of that you know (2505A_0053)
yeah (2505A_0066)
those are neat cats too (2505A_0067)
they're really nice looking cats (2505A_0070)
i have seven cats (2505A_0071)
but they're all along or else (2505A_0072)
well they're the ones that need homes (2505A_0074)
you know mine we're just all  strays in the neighborhood (2505A_0076)
baby kittens dropped and stuff (2505A_0077)
just kind of i'm bill (2505A_0078)
one at a time just (2505A_0079)
can you know (2505A_0080)
one time two of them came at once (2505A_0081)
i can't turn hungry cat down (2505A_0082)
so you know (2505A_0084)
the last one that i was here (2505A_0085)
the kids brought him over and said he was injured (2505A_0086)
and it was winter time (2505A_0087)
i said i just can not have another cat (2505A_0088)
can i have another cat (2505A_0089)
and i looked at the (2505A_0090)
he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and (2505A_0091)
and i said i can't stand it (2505A_0093)
those are my children (2505A_0095)
we don't have very many activities (2505A_0097)
but (2505A_0098)
 yeah (2505A_0110)
turtle (2505A_0111)
she'll eventually (2505A_0114)
mine you know i have five males and two females (2505A_0115)
everybody's space (2505A_0116)
everybody's neutered (2505A_0117)
and we still have a scrap every now and then (2505A_0118)
nothing real bad you know (2505A_0119)
slap here and there (2505A_0120)
but  they put up with each other (2505A_0121)
and they will eventually (2505A_0122)
nose will be out of joint for a while (2505A_0123)
she'll hiss and growl and slap burned down there (2505A_0124)
but they'll she'll finally accept it (2505A_0125)
you know they really don't have any choice (2505A_0126)
in my household we have a little bit of a fight for who's boss (2505A_0128)
you know male cats or are you know real territorial (2505A_0129)
so that's the big battle here you know (2505A_0130)
who's who's top job top cat i guess (2505A_0131)
you know but  (2505A_0133)
i don't i don't know (2505A_0134)
you don't have a problem with it (2505A_0135)
i think they just learn takes (2505A_0136)
and i have two dogs too (2505A_0137)
and they've slap the dogs around (2505A_0138)
yeah (2505A_0141)
yeah (2505A_0145)
but she'll accept another cat eventually (2505A_0146)
you make her feel  like she's still loved and everything (2505A_0147)
gosh (2505A_0157)
yeah (2505A_0160)
three hundred and fifty dollars ooh (2505A_0161)
house payment (2505A_0167)
that is a lot of money (2505A_0169)
i don't let mine out anyway (2505A_0174)
two of 'em out just in the back yard every now and then (2505A_0176)
my cats are into (2505A_0177)
i'm afraid you know neighbors (2505A_0178)
people's her roxanne (2505A_0179)
people run over  (2505A_0181)
i i just you know i just don't (2505A_0182)
yes (2505A_0183)
and now they've lost the desire (2505A_0184)
most of them don't even try to you know go out (2505A_0185)
i just have to drive me crazy but out in the back (2505A_0186)
but i won't let them get (2505A_0189)
if they start going in the front step i bring a man (2505A_0190)
yeah i just worry (2505A_0192)
i guess i'm too protective (2505A_0193)
but (2505A_0194)
cities catheter wandering around neighborhood (2505A_0195)
to that catch diseases really easy (2505A_0196)
just by touching the nose to another cat they can contact leukemia feline leukemia (2505A_0199)
so (2505A_0200)
you know we try try real hard to keep them healthy (2505A_0202)
 how neat (2505A_0204)
people do it for their children (2505A_0208)
i mean why (2505A_0209)
yeah (2505A_0211)
why not (2505A_0212)
yeah (2505A_0214)
yeah (2505A_0217)
well if you're off off of her you know away from a row (2505A_0218)
yeah (2505A_0219)
you're off of the main road (2505A_0220)
from a route you know and you keep an eye on her it's probably okay (2505A_0223)
i'm just real (2505A_0224)
i don't know (2505A_0225)
i'm in a neighborhood (2505A_0226)
it's it's just real tough on animals here you know (2505A_0227)
everytime i see one run over i just you know (2505A_0230)
makes me sick (2505A_0231)
so yeah (2505A_0232)
but anyway we kinda got off the subject for children (2505A_0234)
except that i consider them my children (2505A_0236)
yeah (2505A_0240)
yeah (2505A_0243)
little (2505A_0244)
 i'm sure it's been done (2505A_0247)
it has been done (2505A_0248)
well they have weddings for dogs now and cats (2505A_0249)
you know you they have all that parties form where they dress up (2505A_0252)
i've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress or animals that day go too far (2505A_0253)
i haven't gone that far (2505A_0255)
not that bonkers (2505A_0256)
you know my cat's do not work (2505A_0258)
yeah (2505A_0261)
well do do any of your friends have pets  older children that they do anything with (2505A_0267)
do you have friends with all their children (2505A_0268)
they just all have young kids (2505A_0269)
younger brother and they just at the beginning of the vacation where she got better so not only see the better here but she got all the attention because he got to go out he planned it she's only five but i think she she got all that attention from yeah  see (2505A_0285)
she needed that didn't change (2505A_0286)
yeah it must be hard when you have a lot of children (2505A_0290)
you know i was an only child (2505A_0291)
there was an only child (2505A_0292)
so i you know i wasn't raised with brothers or sisters (2505A_0293)
i always got all the attention (2505A_0294)
so i wouldn't know (2505A_0295)
i think i would be extremely jealous i would have been have you ever get another child in the family (2505A_0296)
tough (2505A_0299)
must be tough (2505A_0300)
yeah (2505A_0302)
yeah (2505A_0303)
she is she's the middle one (2505A_0304)
so she's never been the only one (2505A_0306)
so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one (2505A_0307)
yeah (2505A_0309)
that's tough you know (2505A_0310)
talk about the activities that we don't do (2505B_0000)
i don't have any children so but i i have a lot of friends with children and i know they spend a lotta time with them which is good that's good to hear (2505B_0007)
yeah (2505B_0008)
i haven't  (2505B_0009)
i've been around a lotta people lately it at my job that don't have a lot of values (2505B_0010)
it's it's always nice to see people that like each other (2505B_0012)
like  families and get along with each other and like to do things together (2505B_0013)
 the one that the most valueless girl doesn't (2505B_0020)
but she's married (2505B_0021)
nah i i'm not quite sure why (2505B_0022)
i think he said that he'd give her a big rang and she got married to him (2505B_0023)
but it's it's kind of weight on me (2505B_0025)
and then the other day my husband and i met a couple who who (2505B_0026)
they're just going to have their first child (2505B_0027)
they really like each other (2505B_0028)
real happy with one another (2505B_0029)
and she says things like i'm really glad when he comes home (2505B_0030)
there's not enough time to spend with them in the evening (2505B_0031)
and (2505B_0032)
i'm like really (2505B_0034)
yeah (2505B_0037)
 yeah (2505B_0049)
right (2505B_0052)
on sunday we just met  a family (2505B_0054)
we were thinking about getting main coon cat (2505B_0055)
and we went over to a lady that breeds them here in town (2505B_0056)
and  her daughter actually (2505B_0057)
she said to her husband said to her daughter you need a hobby (2505B_0058)
so she took the cat (2505B_0059)
and you can tell it's a family hobby (2505B_0061)
they're all a part of it (2505B_0062)
it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and and the cats (2505B_0063)
and they raise champion cats (2505B_0064)
so they've done really well (2505B_0065)
yeah (2505B_0068)
just learned about that breed (2505B_0069)
well that's what we're going to end up getting (2505B_0073)
 yeah (2505B_0075)
 i know (2505B_0083)
yeah (2505B_0099)
i know what you mean (2505B_0100)
our cat hates other cats (2505B_0101)
and we've tried to get her to like other cats (2505B_0102)
and she just she wants to be around human beings (2505B_0103)
and she does not want to be around other cats (2505B_0104)
our next (2505B_0105)
we are going to try it with a kitten and see of her maternal instinct come out (2505B_0106)
yeah (2505B_0109)
yeah (2505B_0139)
yeah (2505B_0140)
they got to keep them in line (2505B_0144)
yeah (2505B_0149)
those maine coon cats were great (2505B_0150)
they were fourteen pounds and (2505B_0151)
 they're just gorgeous (2505B_0153)
but yeah (2505B_0154)
three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten (2505B_0156)
and i think of those (2505B_0158)
i think of the kittens at the pound (2505B_0159)
yeah (2505B_0162)
yeah (2505B_0163)
and they are lovely (2505B_0164)
but (2505B_0165)
right (2505B_0168)
yeah (2505B_0170)
she's saying you know you can't let them outside (2505B_0171)
you can't do all this stuff (2505B_0172)
like  (2505B_0173)
yeah (2505B_0197)
yeah (2505B_0198)
yeah (2505B_0201)
we just bought an acre a house with an acre to try to so she'll have some room to walk around and not off of a busy street (2505B_0203)
were choosing our house for our cat (2505B_0206)
isn't that bad (2505B_0207)
'cause she loves she's one of those that loves outside (2505B_0213)
and she doesn't go far (2505B_0215)
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom (2505B_0216)
yeah (2505B_0221)
yeah (2505B_0222)
yeah (2505B_0228)
it gets hard especially with the car (2505B_0229)
 i know (2505B_0233)
yeah (2505B_0235)
cats are a kid (2505B_0238)
we we got married a few months ago (2505B_0241)
and i'm like well why can't actually be at the wedding (2505B_0242)
so i could  (2505B_0246)
i'm sure it's been done they have weddings for dogs and cats  (2505B_0251)
 really (2505B_0254)
yeah (2505B_0257)
i don't think they'd like (2505B_0260)
i put a boa on her one on (2505B_0262)
and there and just kept saying you are the meanest person (2505B_0263)
took a picture of (2505B_0265)
and that was all it all it lasted for (2505B_0266)
 yeah (2505B_0270)
all the ones i know (2505B_0271)
my brother in law has three young kids seven and on down (2505B_0272)
they they go on family vacations (2505B_0273)
and  they go like to go skiing (2505B_0274)
the the middle of girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention (2505B_0275)
but  this last ski trip they took  he had contracted chicken pox first (2505B_0276)
then she spread it to her her younger sister and her brother (2505B_0277)
and they got it and just at the beginning of the vacation where she got better (2505B_0278)
so she not only see the better skier but she got all the attention because she got to go out (2505B_0279)
she planned it (2505B_0280)
she's only five (2505B_0281)
but i think she (2505B_0282)
you got all the attention from her dad (2505B_0284)
wow (2505B_0287)
 yeah (2505B_0288)
yeah (2505B_0297)
it's it's we can work with her (2505B_0298)
she's frustrated (2505B_0301)
yeah (2505B_0305)
right (2505B_0308)
so what are you (2567A_0000)
what's your opinion on the our policy down there (2567A_0001)
i didn't know we had one either (2567A_0003)
yeah (2567A_0008)
yeah (2567A_0012)
the only thing that i've pretty much know about is central american policy where you know just trying to (2567A_0013)
military action in panama that's the only thing that comes to my mind right now (2567A_0014)
and then (2567A_0016)
right (2567A_0019)
right (2567A_0022)
that sort of  (2567A_0023)
we didn't do anything (2567A_0024)
yeah (2567A_0027)
that it that is pretty  risky (2567A_0029)
i mean (2567A_0030)
he takes more risks (2567A_0040)
yeah (2567A_0043)
seems as though the policies  pretty much anywhere not just in central america that us has now is is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric (2567A_0047)
it's you know like we we backup what we what we say with action (2567A_0048)
i don't know how long it's going to last (2567A_0052)
yea (2567A_0056)
i don't think it's possible because even though you know we're against them i don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other countries problem (2567A_0058)
yea (2567A_0061)
but (2567A_0062)
yeah (2567A_0064)
say the thing when panama was that the that  noriega was  was was  was wanted you know the fbi by the fbi (2567A_0065)
and therefore they (2567A_0066)
but to go in and take out the whole drug king them would be something totally different because (2567A_0067)
right (2567A_0069)
i didn't (2567A_0073)
 the drug problem (2567A_0077)
     yeah (2567A_0079)
right (2567A_0086)
i don't think  i don't think in the  problem about drugs are going to be faith anytime soon (2567A_0088)
i mean you know i think you're pretty much got sidetracked with  with the panama and and with the yeah middle east problems (2567A_0089)
things that that are more important take president precedence over the drugs i think (2567A_0090)
i think the big thing is trying to stop that you're on the home front (2567A_0091)
and (2567A_0092)
it'll take a little bit of time before they realize that this is failing (2567A_0093)
so they're going to have to go to the source (2567A_0094)
admit it yet (2567A_0099)
right (2567A_0101)
yeah (2567A_0103)
yeah (2567A_0104)
true (2567A_0105)
yeah (2567A_0111)
depends on how much power you have in who you know (2567A_0116)
yeah (2567A_0121)
probably (2567A_0125)
i don't drink scotch (2567A_0129)
yeah (2567A_0136)
i think we're trying to stay  stay friendly with  the  the brazilian and and argentinian governments 'cause they're producing so much  agriculture oil exports (2567A_0137)
they don't want it pissed them off and have them over produced (2567A_0140)
and then 'cause then our economy would be pretty bad yeah (2567A_0143)
i think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better (2567A_0151)
you know same old cliche (2567A_0152)
right (2567A_0156)
right (2567A_0158)
just pick crooked people again (2567A_0159)
and people the the wrong people just fight their way up to the topic (2567A_0160)
 all beef or nothing (2567A_0161)
yeah (2567A_0168)
well i guess that's about five minutes (2567A_0169)
for say talking to you (2567A_0170)
what was that (2567A_0175)
that you're saying read (2567A_0177)
clear and present danger (2567A_0182)
okay (2567A_0185)
alright (2567A_0186)
alright (2567A_0188)
thanks a lot (2567A_0189)
i don't think we have one (2567B_0002)
yeah (2567B_0004)
i said it's kinda hard to have have an opinion (2567B_0005)
we seem to you (2567B_0006)
whoever screams the loudest yeah or whoever we happened given the most money to at that particular time we seem to support without regard whether it's a democracy or anything else (2567B_0007)
well (2567B_0015)
yeah and then of course there were there was the  in columbia with the drug lords (2567B_0018)
but we just talk to (2567B_0020)
actually doing (2567B_0021)
i'm actually surprised anything in central america animal (2567B_0025)
i was kinda surprised who did that (2567B_0026)
after our friend jimmy carter gave away anyway (2567B_0031)
i guess they had to finally do something (2567B_0035)
i see bush has been better than i thought (2567B_0036)
he has a little more down a little more of a stand on policy then i thought he would (2567B_0038)
i was considering kind of a wimp (2567B_0039)
yeah (2567B_0041)
reagan and this guy much now (2567B_0042)
but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is a combination of reagan carter neither foot forward through much as you know policy makers (2567B_0045)
yeah (2567B_0049)
so far (2567B_0050)
really haven't (2567B_0051)
of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords (2567B_0055)
i mean or if you could see if we do that (2567B_0057)
 we didn't animal (2567B_0059)
didn't saudi arabia (2567B_0060)
it'd be an interesting problem (2567B_0068)
i don't know if they could do it or not (2567B_0070)
did you read tom clancy is a clear and present danger (2567B_0071)
you need to get it (2567B_0074)
but  it's quite interesting (2567B_0075)
the grass is a problem (2567B_0076)
actually he he wrote that prior to the  mundane cartel being exposed (2567B_0080)
is on the stance prior to that time (2567B_0081)
it's quite timely (2567B_0082)
you know somebody (2567B_0083)
he has a real good  good imagination (2567B_0084)
it's it's pretty close to home (2567B_0085)
i don't think we're going to have much of a choice and he came in central or south america (2567B_0087)
yeah (2567B_0095)
i think he realizes fail (2567B_0096)
nobody wants to make it yet nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going invading (2567B_0098)
we still have told me that there's too many kiddies and miss involved and you know that there (2567B_0102)
there's too many liberals are control (2567B_0106)
i can't agree on anything (2567B_0107)
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes (2567B_0108)
as long as somebody's getting killed as long as i know the okay (2567B_0109)
but the minute it hits hits the papers and of course the kennedys missing vows you dollars in the in  the dodgers from georgia state and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is (2567B_0110)
course the the same people that also drown blonde the traffic wedding and stuff like that (2567B_0112)
i guess at all (2567B_0114)
it's all a matter of perspective (2567B_0115)
yeah (2567B_0117)
people have a right to know except for about what what what concerns (2567B_0118)
and these people that make the foreign policy (2567B_0122)
is this probably basically  (2567B_0123)
i wouldn't be surprised at security foundation or some of those don't have a lot of  financial holdings in in central and south america (2567B_0124)
considering the kennedys made all their money off the bootleg whisky anyway (2567B_0126)
every time you drink scotch are paying kennedy (2567B_0128)
yeah (2567B_0130)
don't ever drinks (2567B_0131)
terrible (2567B_0132)
i couldn't when i found out about that (2567B_0133)
anyway (2567B_0134)
 far as far as you know central south america we our policy pretty much  it depends on who were what government well buying down there to take your time (2567B_0135)
yeah (2567B_0141)
we do need to do something about you know (2567B_0144)
of course in nicaragua around there with the sandinistas and the congress that's been going on for years (2567B_0145)
but then he'll probably still be going along after were dead (2567B_0146)
doing the same thing (2567B_0147)
people down there don't really (2567B_0149)
i think i can't figure out what they want down there (2567B_0153)
gave everybody what they wanted their air it was a complete democracies those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education (2567B_0157)
it's all traditional (2567B_0162)
it's all traditional (2567B_0164)
yeah (2567B_0165)
yeah they're really class (2567B_0166)
and he had everybody else (2567B_0167)
already (2567B_0173)
totally (2567B_0174)
tom clancy (2567B_0178)
totally clear and present danger (2567B_0181)
right he's the one who wrote that red october i'm hooked on (2567B_0184)
i think if you read that many a real kick out (2567B_0187)
well as much as i'd  i'd like to say that i'll be looking for  flashy convertible  four by four something (2702A_0001)
i guess the next car i'll be looking for is  kind of a plain old for it or (2702A_0002)
 we've got a  an older (2702A_0004)
and then   newer cars they  of course it go (2702A_0005)
and that will probably be looking for something about that  that same style (2702A_0007)
and can't afford or hard top style (2702A_0009)
 no (2702A_0011)
but we're playing for it (2702A_0012)
so  that  our oldsmobile that isn't like an old old a._d._a. (2702A_0014)
but it's been pretty good really good shape (2702A_0015)
and we've been really pleased with those will bills (2702A_0017)
that's probably the first place we look (2702A_0019)
that'll do it (2702A_0025)
yeah (2702A_0030)
 jeeze (2702A_0040)
yeah (2702A_0046)
really (2702A_0048)
 jeeze (2702A_0053)
yeah (2702A_0059)
yeah (2702A_0060)
 yeah (2702A_0063)
yeah (2702A_0066)
sounds like you you need at least like a tourist sites (2702A_0068)
yeah (2702A_0075)
i know a lot of the guys at work (2702A_0076)
they are the ones that have families (2702A_0077)
and they still one kind of a sports car (2702A_0078)
i mean a lot of them and getting these  tourists s h o shows (2702A_0079)
i guess it's sports version of a tourist (2702A_0080)
it comes to the standard stick (2702A_0084)
and  and a lot of those (2702A_0085)
comes to the bigger engine and things like that (2702A_0088)
but  (2702A_0089)
and usually during like black and governmental gray and and those kind of color (2702A_0091)
not going to see too many  you know green ones are blue ones or anything like that (2702A_0094)
they they put 'em in forty colors i guess (2702A_0096)
yeah (2702A_0097)
 for sure (2702A_0100)
yeah (2702A_0102)
so do you look at the price (2702A_0103)
and then you go what (2702A_0104)
what would i besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun and all that i really do with us (2702A_0107)
yeah (2702A_0114)
i i went i went through that when i first got out of college (2702A_0115)
i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my my first job (2702A_0118)
i got their first thing i did was traded on spit fire (2702A_0120)
i knew that was going to be the only time i could afford it two seater a sports car (2702A_0122)
but that that just does not make it as an only car (2702A_0124)
 like  i would (2702A_0126)
i bought a set of stereo speakers (2702A_0127)
it was one of those cash and carry a deal (2702A_0129)
i had to take  one of the time with the top down (2702A_0130)
and it was winter so i was like in his coat with the top down (2702A_0133)
and the speaker and the passengers (2702A_0136)
and i drove that one (2702A_0138)
i went back and got the other one and put them to pass just drove that one  (2702A_0139)
and  funny the funniest (2702A_0142)
that you kinda outgrow that real quick when is your own a car (2702A_0143)
yea (2702A_0152)
 really (2702A_0156)
yeah (2702A_0158)
boy that's a good deal (2702A_0165)
 okay (2702A_0167)
well after all that for every in that situation (2702A_0168)
cause i i know we've  (2702A_0174)
that's that's something that that would definitely have to go with an automatic transmission (2702A_0175)
my  my wife just as a kid can't can't (2702A_0176)
she doesn't really want to learn i guess the the standard shift (2702A_0177)
in fact i i remember once we  we went  went on a a test drive (2702A_0181)
when these things from coca that said you know give you a fifty dollar savings bond test drive a car (2702A_0182)
and we went  we went  we went to a dealership (2702A_0186)
and  it was it was pretty much she she did pretty well (2702A_0187)
but it was on these things where we just went to a big parking lot (2702A_0188)
and the  dealer kinda gave her standards shift parking (2702A_0190)
that's all (2702A_0191)
it was the funniest thing (2702A_0192)
it was like a a big old (2702A_0193)
apple a barren with everything on it (2702A_0196)
but it had a standard shift (2702A_0198)
craziest thing i ever saw (2702A_0199)
and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess (2702A_0203)
and  we just kinda went back and forth and back (2702A_0205)
she's pretty well after a while (2702A_0206)
 it's kinda hard to learn i guess (2702A_0208)
 okay (2702A_0216)
 gee (2702A_0220)
yeah (2702A_0223)
yeah (2702A_0225)
 well (2702A_0227)
well i guess that i guess the ball i got to say (2702A_0228)
i would think so (2702A_0237)
because it's so big (2702A_0240)
 yeah (2702A_0244)
sure (2702A_0247)
sure (2702A_0248)
now now now that used to be a luxury (2702A_0255)
i bet on the next time you buy a car that's going to be mandatory (2702A_0256)
you gotta have that now (2702A_0258)
you're used to (2702A_0261)
and you gotta have it (2702A_0262)
that's true (2702A_0265)
it probably does (2702A_0267)
it probably does (2702A_0270)
 well (2702A_0273)
well bill it's been nice talking to you (2702A_0274)
okay (2702A_0276)

you got kids (2702B_0010)
okay (2702B_0013)
yeah (2702B_0016)
yeah (2702B_0018)
we've always had  ford's (2702B_0022)
 mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a ford dealership (2702B_0024)
yeah (2702B_0026)
i'll do it (2702B_0027)
 but yeah where where in the same shape (2702B_0028)
i think our next car will be  you know some big old ford or  something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons (2702B_0029)
and we've got a mini van (2702B_0032)
and that's great (2702B_0034)
and i i drive  (2702B_0035)
well i used to drive an escort (2702B_0036)
but it died on me (2702B_0037)
so i i mean i i i used to run it   where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day (2702B_0039)
and  and this escort took it all (2702B_0041)
and it got  i was at ninety four thousand miles on it (2702B_0042)
and just went (2702B_0043)
so i i i bought a used  dodge aries which has been okay (2702B_0045)
i mean i haven't had it that long (2702B_0049)
but it it'll it's an eighty five area (2702B_0051)
but it only hit thirty four thousand miles on when i bought it (2702B_0052)
and i just you know i just driving to work (2702B_0054)
so it's just a ten minute commute every day so (2702B_0055)
 it doesn't get much of a (2702B_0057)
i mean it's not like i'm putting it through it spaces (2702B_0058)
but i think  (2702B_0061)
and it's a four door which is nice (2702B_0062)
but it's still a little cramped (2702B_0064)
i've got three kids (2702B_0065)
so i (2702B_0067)
yeah (2702B_0069)
that's what i was thinking (2702B_0070)
a taurus (2702B_0073)
 really (2702B_0081)
yeah (2702B_0083)
ooh (2702B_0086)

yeah (2702B_0098)
well my wife wants to (2702B_0099)
right (2702B_0105)
right (2702B_0108)
yeah (2702B_0109)
i know (2702B_0111)
like i i guess i could fit in it maybe (2702B_0113)
yeah (2702B_0119)
yeah (2702B_0121)
yeah (2702B_0123)
yeah (2702B_0128)
 no (2702B_0134)
yeah (2702B_0144)
yeah (2702B_0146)
yeah (2702B_0147)
it's funny (2702B_0148)
most people that i've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college or you know when they were single anyway (2702B_0149)
they buy themselves a sporty car because it was (2702B_0153)
i never did that (2702B_0154)
you know my first call was a toyota (2702B_0155)
and  because i got a good deal on it (2702B_0157)
and  it was a great little (2702B_0159)
actually i met (2702B_0160)
that's how i met girls was i'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i i'd never (2702B_0161)
i i'd learn on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive his car (2702B_0162)
and in fact i married one of those (2702B_0166)
and there were (2702B_0169)
yeah (2702B_0171)
worked out right real good (2702B_0172)
yeah (2702B_0178)
yeah (2702B_0179)
yeah (2702B_0183)
yeah (2702B_0185)
yeah (2702B_0189)
wow (2702B_0197)
that's weird (2702B_0200)
yeah (2702B_0202)
yeah (2702B_0207)
 my wife (2702B_0209)
she'd always driven standard transmission (2702B_0210)
and  (2702B_0212)
fact all our earlier cars were a standard transition (2702B_0214)
in fact the mini van so has a stick shift (2702B_0215)
and (2702B_0217)
this  jerry's is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything (2702B_0218)
and it's got automatic transmission cruise control electrical locks (2702B_0219)
you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that if a dodge every so often (2702B_0222)
yeah (2702B_0231)
the thing about this  (2702B_0232)
i will say this about the mini van (2702B_0233)
thought that was electric harlem about it (2702B_0235)
yeah (2702B_0239)
yeah (2702B_0241)
and and it was quiet (2702B_0242)
stereo system (2702B_0243)
we never had it (2702B_0245)
we always had the am radio (2702B_0246)
and  is has they ship it had speakers that you can control in the back seat (2702B_0249)
and you could change the channels on the on the radio from the two (2702B_0251)
and puts speaker phones in it (2702B_0253)
right (2702B_0257)
that's right (2702B_0259)
that's right (2702B_0260)
and you got to pay for it too (2702B_0263)
i bet i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought my (2702B_0266)
nice talking to you (2702B_0275)
thanks a lot (2702B_0278)
bye bye (2702B_0281)
what (2733A_0000)
right now we i've got a four year old subaru and a two year old honda (2733A_0002)
really (2733A_0012)
i bet (2733A_0026)
i bet (2733A_0028)
yeah (2733A_0039)
 no (2733A_0045)
well yeah (2733A_0061)
we had  we had (2733A_0062)
the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves (2733A_0063)
the others were hand me downs through the families (2733A_0065)
and those were always jam cars (2733A_0067)
and  we were real happy with (2733A_0071)
but all the ones that we ever had were the yeah eight cylinder (2733A_0072)
really why good gm cars (2733A_0074)
and all we had heard was was a lotta negative press about the smaller cars (2733A_0078)
and we both drive or forty five miles round trip every day (2733A_0079)
so we wanted a smaller car (2733A_0082)
when we got ready to buy when you to smaller car to get better gas mileage (2733A_0084)
and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the gym small cars (2733A_0085)
you know as far as their ability (2733A_0088)
we kind of (2733A_0090)
when we had our larger cars we didn't mind  keeping them up (2733A_0091)
you know doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often (2733A_0093)
once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them all of them (2733A_0095)
it just kinda seemed to be the magic number four (2733A_0096)
yeah (2733A_0100)
right (2733A_0115)
it's like  (2733A_0121)
yeah (2733A_0124)
we we felt are are we we trade it in our lives sabre for (2733A_0126)
yeah (2733A_0128)
it was great car (2733A_0129)
it just (2733A_0131)
we've random wheels right off of it (2733A_0132)
that's right (2733A_0154)
 and  basketball  we went up to the local budget he said i'll tell ya   and i hated to turn that back in (2733A_0173)
yeah (2733A_0177)
i wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas either (2733A_0179)
 and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it improves control what about sixty and let it let it flow  and it was pretty nice (2733A_0186)
yeah (2733A_0188)
no time saying (2733A_0193)
 we're we won't have any more license drivers for about thirteen years (2733A_0194)
yes (2733A_0198)
so we  so we don't plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon (2733A_0200)
both of our cars are getting  round sixty thousand miles on (2733A_0201)
we drive a lot (2733A_0205)
we haven't been looking at the very popular around  (2733A_0220)
really (2733A_0237)
that'd be a good idea (2733A_0243)
yeah (2733A_0246)
we've we've we've kind of been the types it will say this is what we intend to spend (2733A_0247)
this is the car we want (2733A_0249)
well you still need this car for that price (2733A_0250)
and and we've had (2733A_0252)
when we bought our the guy was like you can't do this (2733A_0254)
where it's like okay fine we we won't then (2733A_0255)
like (2733A_0259)
good yeah (2733A_0290)
that's right (2733A_0301)
 what what kind of do you usually drive (2733B_0001)
 my goodness (2733B_0003)
well we're we're we're sort of sort of a general motors family (2733B_0004)
i guess that's the way we were raised (2733B_0005)
and   we were overseas the ti for a number of years (2733B_0006)
and when we came back we suddenly find that we've got five license drivers in the family (2733B_0007)
yeah (2733B_0009)
and four cars (2733B_0010)
and we bought some year old cars from national car rental (2733B_0011)
at least two of them (2733B_0013)
we bought an old kelly interviewing skyline (2733B_0014)
 from (2733B_0015)
twenty one thousand miles something like that (2733B_0016)
turns out that's pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain (2733B_0018)
and they can show you the record they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that (2733B_0019)
then we got an eighty six chevy spectrum that we bought (2733B_0020)
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it far (2733B_0021)
and we've got an eighty four toyota that we bought use (2733B_0023)
so we've got four cars for our five license drivers (2733B_0024)
like musical chairs (2733B_0025)
sure (2733B_0027)
and  (2733B_0029)
you know it's interesting that (2733B_0030)
even though my dad was a shovel a man forever and ever ever (2733B_0031)
and we were in the retail business (2733B_0032)
and he had all chevrolet trucks (2733B_0033)
and we bought automobiles and all that (2733B_0034)
he was almost like (2733B_0035)
and it was almost like a mini if we got old about anything like  the chevrolet it'd be like going and sitting on his grave (2733B_0037)
but  (2733B_0038)
we get older and got away (2733B_0040)
and then we thought well you know you still could buy general motors products (2733B_0041)
and it was probably not that bad (2733B_0042)
 we lived in malaysia for ti in nineteen eighty one two three and four (2733B_0044)
and of course you don't buy general motors practice (2733B_0046)
but we bought a (2733B_0048)
and i have never had a car that i love more (2733B_0049)
i just can't afford them (2733B_0050)
 but i i just love that car (2733B_0051)
and  we bought a  (2733B_0053)
we lived in the philippines for ti eighty five eighty six eighty seven (2733B_0054)
and we bought a a ford tell us (2733B_0055)
which is somewhat similar to the terrorist (2733B_0056)
sold in the in the far east and far east countries more than (2733B_0057)
we really like that (2733B_0059)
and if you had experience with the ones you had (2733B_0060)
 there there is for him it down to the family yeah (2733B_0066)
yeah (2733B_0068)
yeah (2733B_0073)
to be (2733B_0075)
yeah (2733B_0077)
does drive or forty five miles round trip (2733B_0080)
sure (2733B_0081)
yeah (2733B_0083)
right (2733B_0089)
yeah (2733B_0097)
yeah (2733B_0098)
it seems that something goes every month (2733B_0099)
i'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of our (2733B_0102)
we got three eighty sixes and in eighty four (2733B_0104)
and we'll probably be there with all of them (2733B_0106)
it's the same thing (2733B_0107)
 classified as skyrocket and kelly (2733B_0108)
well i guess they're intermediates (2733B_0109)
 but  we went on a family trip to massachusetts (2733B_0111)
five (2733B_0112)
 five five of us never go anywhere together here (2733B_0113)
everybody's heading off in their own direction (2733B_0114)
and i rented a bjork was sabre (2733B_0116)
and it's the first big cat i had since i had my nine passenger in power station wagon from seventy six to eight (2733B_0118)
and it made all (2733B_0119)
i had forgotten what driving the big car was like (2733B_0120)
it was just nice (2733B_0122)
it's loaded (2733B_0123)
 yeah (2733B_0127)
yeah (2733B_0130)
yeah (2733B_0133)
uh-huh (2733B_0134)
and (2733B_0135)
and  you know i've read (2733B_0136)
i'm in the quality businesses (2733B_0137)
quality manager (2733B_0138)
and we're we're  we do (2733B_0139)
so (2733B_0140)
i'm in the semi conductor group (2733B_0141)
we sell to  ford chrysler and gm (2733B_0142)
and there is  amazing (2733B_0144)
i am just  really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that the those these companies are put into their procurement (2733B_0145)
and it's it's coming about as a result of the competition from the japanese (2733B_0146)
and   (2733B_0148)
i and you know we used to think forward products were attending (2733B_0149)
i was growing up (2733B_0150)
i was taught that i've grown up you know that it's real people bought general motors products (2733B_0151)
yeah and bought or products (2733B_0153)
but just with the quality requirements that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants (2733B_0156)
really   stressing this partnerships and quality (2733B_0157)
you know gym a chrysler doing (2733B_0158)
i really think forward going to leadership position in this right now (2733B_0159)
and i think it showing up in their automobile (2733B_0160)
they're automobiles of getting a very good quality reputation right now (2733B_0161)
and   we went to  austin awhile back to a basketball tournament (2733B_0163)
we're going to me means on my wife's relatives now (2733B_0164)
so we decided to drive one of our cars now we rent one (2733B_0165)
and we went up to the local budget (2733B_0167)
and we were going to get a old eighty eight or something (2733B_0168)
he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more give me a link in town (2733B_0169)
and we drove (2733B_0171)
and i hated to turn that back in (2733B_0172)
yeah we had that for three days (2733B_0174)
and i absolutely (2733B_0175)
except i wouldn't want to have to pocket and type places all the time (2733B_0176)
but i absolutely love that automobile (2733B_0180)
and you know it wasn't that (2733B_0181)
driving around down there we might have got sixteen eighteen miles per gallon (2733B_0182)
but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going (2733B_0183)
so i knew i actually got  (2733B_0184)
it was about twenty four miles a gallon (2733B_0185)
and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control what about sixty and let it let it flow (2733B_0187)
and it was pretty nice (2733B_0189)
are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars (2733B_0190)
here's a small (2733B_0197)
sixty  yeah (2733B_0204)
yeah (2733B_0206)
he probably got another another thirty or forty thousand to maintain it (2733B_0207)
 we've got (2733B_0209)
probably will get something in the next couple of years (2733B_0210)
my son will graduated from high school is (2733B_0211)
and he's going to go to the original in college one year behind us (2733B_0212)
right (2733B_0214)
in fact our house is  adjacent to the original in property (2733B_0215)
he wants to go to texas tech (2733B_0216)
he's probably going to have to go to richland the year to get some grades in order to (2733B_0217)
but  the next year when he goes out the tech he wants to pick on (2733B_0218)
i want to pick up (2733B_0219)
i may get one night let 'em have that (2733B_0222)
we have been looking at these red shirt (2733B_0223)
they're very popular around here (2733B_0224)
red chevy pick up (2733B_0226)
and  we'll probably do something like that (2733B_0227)
incidentally (2733B_0228)
  i don't know (2733B_0229)
 the  the credit union is gotta deal now where you decide what you want (2733B_0230)
you call this number (2733B_0231)
and  they go negotiate the price (2733B_0232)
and and the our our send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal (2733B_0233)
and  my boss just bought a chevy pick up (2733B_0235)
and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way (2733B_0236)
and   you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can't and then go call this guy and and tell them what you want (2733B_0239)
he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealers place (2733B_0240)
so i'm going to try that the next time i bought one (2733B_0242)
and so you know and go around in comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation or (2733B_0244)
what's that one thing it's a pain in the neck buying automobiles negotiating (2733B_0245)
yeah well you still need this car for that price (2733B_0251)
laura (2733B_0256)
yeah (2733B_0257)
and  and i i think that's probably the way you got to do it (2733B_0262)
when i was young i went in and bought a   made a deal on a sixty (2733B_0263)
nineteen sixty (2733B_0264)
first come to texas and made a deal on a sixty red in power convertible and i just love (2733B_0265)
and this guy gave me a steel (2733B_0269)
i told him i didn't want to pay (2733B_0270)
for every fifty dollars you'd have to go in and check with the boss (2733B_0271)
and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate  we would go ahead and buy (2733B_0272)
  if he could get this rate i promise to buy (2733B_0273)
and i left there on a saturday afternoon just totally exhausted (2733B_0274)
i was only twenty five years old or something (2733B_0275)
i left there (2733B_0277)
and i i  i never done this before 'cause i'd always bought my previous cash and the guy my dad bought his milk trucks (2733B_0278)
and   so i i got back (2733B_0279)
in a salesman lived in the apartment i did ask me or  (2733B_0280)
you'd heard i was going to get a car and ask me why pay for it (2733B_0281)
he said well hey  before you go buy anything (2733B_0282)
college friend of mine and will (2733B_0283)
it was a guy that on the chevrolet dealership up there (2733B_0284)
i call a guy named appointment to come up monday morning (2733B_0286)
just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference (2733B_0287)
and i mean it was difference of four hundred dollars (2733B_0288)
but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred (2733B_0289)
all we pay for cars in those days (2733B_0291)
and   so i called back the guy in dallas (2733B_0292)
and i told him (2733B_0293)
i'd left him a check for tax title license and everything (2733B_0294)
and i said i want to cancel my order and and don't try to catch the checks i've stopped payment on already (2733B_0295)
and he says  somebody's taking (2733B_0296)
what'd you get a deal for (2733B_0297)
to somebody's taking you for a ride (2733B_0299)
and i said no somebody took me for a ride last saturday (2733B_0300)
and   and i i find that (2733B_0302)
for the longest time then i drove up to (2733B_0303)
in the in the fella died since then (2733B_0304)
in some of his relatives taking all of the business (2733B_0305)
yeah (2733B_0307)
and since then i had (2733B_0308)
 our children are both  basically adults (3035A_0000)
so we've we've got to (3035A_0001)
 one's twenty one (3035A_0002)
one's twenty five (3035A_0003)
and they they still live at home (3035A_0005)
that's a little unusual for for children to that age to have both of 'em that i get home (3035A_0007)
but  i guess the activities that  we have with them or  pretty few and far between (3035A_0008)
actually  they're both going on their own most of the time (3035A_0009)
so  most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing (3035A_0011)
yeah (3035A_0016)
 yeah (3035A_0023)
yeah (3035A_0024)
yeah (3035A_0028)
yeah (3035A_0031)
the one year old a boy (3035A_0032)
a girl (3035A_0035)
hours  the older one's a girl (3035A_0038)
and  and younger one's a boy (3035A_0040)
yeah (3035A_0041)
 i guess  what i see it so far as  the trends four children  (3035A_0043)
i don't know what kind of  area of virginia beach (3035A_0044)
but of course  richardson's in the dallas area (3035A_0045)
and i think  the big city (3035A_0047)
activities for for children now are (3035A_0048)
they're good (3035A_0049)
but there's so much  potential danger you know (3035A_0050)
really have to watch your children so closely now (3035A_0051)
you can't let them grow up the way the way i grew up you know (3035A_0052)
 i'm from a smaller town in east texas (3035A_0055)
and i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do  my whole life (3035A_0056)
you know never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there (3035A_0059)
and  you know i find it's it's quite a bit different now (3035A_0061)
 you know you'd have to watch your children so closely and  keep up with them (3035A_0062)
i feel like  (3035A_0063)
that it's it's really a sad commentary on  you know on life in general (3035A_0064)
 you know the children can't i can not be allowed to grow up  you know without really close supervision (3035A_0066)
right (3035A_0079)
yeah (3035A_0081)
yeah (3035A_0086)
 i guess looking at  back at what our children dead compared to what  you know what i had to go through in school (3035A_0088)
the  there is there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum (3035A_0089)
it's a lot more complicated (3035A_0090)
a lot more available of course (3035A_0091)
but  there's same (3035A_0093)
so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult i would think (3035A_0094)
i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself (3035A_0095)
you know just (3035A_0097)
or at least it'd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school (3035A_0098)
right (3035A_0105)
yeah (3035A_0107)
yeah (3035A_0113)
i think (3035A_0114)
right (3035A_0121)
yeah (3035A_0122)
yeah (3035A_0128)
yeah (3035A_0133)
 watching a little little boys play soccer is is more fun (3035A_0134)
i can't imagine them having as much fun is that parents had (3035A_0136)
right (3035A_0142)
yeah (3035A_0143)
and and disorganized politeness or or what it was (3035A_0145)
but (3035A_0146)
yeah (3035A_0149)
when ours was  (3035A_0150)
i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer (3035A_0152)
and  and it was it was more fun to watch those boys try and trying to kick the ball up down the field (3035A_0154)
but  (3035A_0156)
i guess that was  you know it was important  as much important to the parents as well as for the children it you know to get out and watch the kids play (3035A_0158)
i guess one of the things that i think about is  talking about education  i kinda feel like  the  the the school systems in as particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control (3035A_0161)
the the students have a little too much  too much leeway (3035A_0162)
excuse me (3035A_0164)
 and and that's kind of contradictory to what i said (3035A_0165)
you know (3035A_0166)
you have to be under control so much when they're out (3035A_0168)
when they're in school like they don't have quite quite as much control over them as  as what i would like to sing (3035A_0169)
  kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on and it's at school (3035A_0176)
and  you know it tends to  to encourage students to not be as you know and not concentrate as much on education (3035A_0178)
you know there there are there for a good time (3035A_0180)
you know to see how little i can get by with (3035A_0182)
why not never people that are in the school district and down and and san antonio and  it seems like it's a lot of the problem is too you know you always have the lack of fun they seem to be getting worse and worse and so they don't have the resources are drawn to give as much supervision (3035A_0190)
but (3035A_0193)
but  i i don't know (3035A_0197)
i think  you know some of the thing has to do with  with the civil rights program (3035A_0198)
not that the civil rights bad (3035A_0201)
but that they're (3035A_0202)
it carries over into you know individual rights (3035A_0203)
you know trickle (3035A_0206)
 we have a three year old and a one year old (3035B_0014)
and  so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know (3035B_0015)
and  most of the time with a three year old we're trying to to get him  (3035B_0017)
we play usually in the evening when when i get home you know about five o'clock or so until about eight exception of dinner (3035B_0018)
out in the front our back yard playing like a tee ball off the you know the ball and then  hit a lot of baseball (3035B_0019)
 since we just got here and we got day  i knew to wheel bike with training wheels on it for him (3035B_0020)
he really likes riding that around (3035B_0021)
so you know (3035B_0025)
trying to supervise them with that and everything and  playing scored guns and all that (3035B_0026)
he really likes it (3035B_0027)
and  the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything (3035B_0029)
trying to do everything he does (3035B_0030)
yeah (3035B_0034)
yeah (3035B_0036)
yeah (3035B_0042)
well i i agree with that (3035B_0067)
and i've seen i've seen to feel the same way (3035B_0068)
even just when i grew up and everything (3035B_0069)
and the and the way it is now you're it's a lot of supervision and it didn't hand and everything (3035B_0070)
 the only other thing i have noticed though is that  it seems that there's been a lot  are more apt to emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with (3035B_0072)
and  looking you know (3035B_0073)
to start (3035B_0074)
not really looking for a school for him but  like a pre school or something an hour ago maybe a couple of hours a couple of days a week or something (3035B_0075)
for for a three year old is that (3035B_0077)
there's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten (3035B_0078)
and it seems like it's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do and when we are then when i had to go into crate in kindergarten (3035B_0080)
and it seems like it's more (3035B_0082)
you know i don't know (3035B_0083)
they're expecting war or  or just  (3035B_0084)
kids just because of the computer age or whatever it just no more but when it gets you know be five or six or something (3035B_0085)
but (3035B_0087)
i got a home computer too (3035B_0100)
and  i play  with a three year old (3035B_0101)
play some computer games and stuff (3035B_0102)
educational games like you know concentration type games  matching things like that (3035B_0104)
and  he he really likes it (3035B_0108)
and  and i think it's important because i think that  you know it gives them the interaction with the computer (3035B_0109)
cause it sure looked like that's going to be  you know the big thing for a long time (3035B_0110)
you haven't given that knowledge and stuff with it (3035B_0112)
and he seems to enjoy it (3035B_0116)
and  of course the one year old hasn't hasn't gotten there yet (3035B_0118)
but  (3035B_0119)
and the other thing we try to do is a sense of summers times here is  signed him up for and her for a different activities at like the rec center or something like (3035B_0120)
you know  (3035B_0123)
there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so (3035B_0125)
and  (3035B_0126)
they go for an hour or so (3035B_0127)
and  (3035B_0129)
because  when he was a baby that we did the swimming too (3035B_0130)
he really liked it (3035B_0131)
so we're going to do that with our daughter too (3035B_0132)
i know (3035B_0139)
 we're just talking about that too (3035B_0140)
i guess they're not really soccer just kind of a well kick the ball around for a while and see what happens (3035B_0141)
yeah (3035B_0147)
right (3035B_0170)
right (3035B_0171)
right (3035B_0173)
yeah (3035B_0179)
right (3035B_0181)
why not never people that are in the in the  school district and down and and  san antonio (3035B_0184)
and  it seems like it's (3035B_0185)
a lot of the problem is too you know (3035B_0186)
you always have the lack of fun (3035B_0187)
it seems to be getting worse and worse (3035B_0188)
and so they don't have the resources to drawn to give as much supervision as you know kids need (3035B_0189)
and  you know that's just the problem that who knows how that's going to that's going to come out or anything (3035B_0192)
but (3035B_0195)
yeah (3129A_0003)
exactly (3129A_0006)
did you do the diagnosis or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed (3129A_0017)
yeah i know (3129A_0029)
 one working with the  flashers there is  usually a special fuse that operate the flashers (3129A_0030)
do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your (3129A_0031)
diagram (3129A_0037)
i don't even know if my current cars have a separate phew (3129A_0040)
i know sometimes when you think there are  things running all while they're at the same unit like the the headlines (3129A_0041)
you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing (3129A_0043)
but sometimes they extra average that are high beam draws as opposed to a low being  requires the use of  of of maybe a higher fuse (3129A_0044)
so that's a possibility (3129A_0047)
is this  a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for  old imports (3129A_0051)
yeah (3129A_0054)
so it's not jc with me or somebody like that (3129A_0058)
yeah (3129A_0066)
have you found any   reliable import service people in the metroplex (3129A_0067)
 yeah (3129A_0072)
i'll be darned (3129A_0078)
 my goodness (3129A_0096)
 no (3129A_0101)
well ours wasn't within the last year (3129A_0104)
i guess it's been within the last two years  (3129A_0105)
judy has an oldsmobile that we bought a new (3129A_0106)
and it's one with the  electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and  (3129A_0107)
i don't know what else at all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort (3129A_0108)
and we found that the   we were having to problems (3129A_0109)
it was idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that  we park on a on a hill under our carport (3129A_0110)
and when you first dropped it into gear it would immediately want a backup into the alley (3129A_0111)
and knowing that they always had to keep your foot on the brake hard (3129A_0112)
otherwise it would just rent control away from (3129A_0113)
and the other problem judy what have is occasionally she would be driving along  d celebrating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stops (3129A_0115)
in the engine would just quit (3129A_0117)
so we took it back to the  the whole place and ask them to check it out (3129A_0119)
and at first they thought it was just a matter of time (3129A_0120)
so they adjusted timing (3129A_0121)
and the problem didn't go away (3129A_0122)
but we ended up taking it back again and (3129A_0123)
i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around (3129A_0124)
but the second time around they lifted their  recall service in their  service reports from region or headquarters whatever (3129A_0125)
and and they had they description of the exact problem we we're experiencing it apparently was a programming air in the  computer control unit (3129A_0126)
which fortunately they replaced under warranty 'cause it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part (3129A_0129)
and  so once they replace that then the the cars seem to work fine for  a considerable period of time (3129A_0131)
now it seems to be (3129A_0134)
we we aren't experiencing the stalling (3129A_0135)
but we're still experiencing a very uneven (3129A_0136)
well time just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity (3129B_0000)
and i had to  i've had a long a joe problem of my bright lights not working (3129B_0001)
 this is the type of  switch where you flip the deliver the turn signal on those column (3129B_0002)
and when i would  put it in the bright light physician the lights would go out completely (3129B_0004)
which is even worse than them just not getting brat (3129B_0005)
and i hadn't presented it was the switch (3129B_0007)
and  this is  an older car (3129B_0008)
seventy two m g (3129B_0009)
so i had to mail order the part (3129B_0010)
which i (3129B_0011)
and i went out and  at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem (3129B_0012)
it's not in the switch because it does the same thing when they switch (3129B_0013)
so i'll be faced with having to return that product  and hoping that  you know that they will accept it (3129B_0015)
what's been removed the box it's obviously not been really used (3129B_0016)
 i had done what diagnosis that could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram than i did have with a car and that pretty much decided that that had to be the problem (3129B_0018)
i talked to one mechanic about it (3129B_0021)
he's suspected this which also (3129B_0022)
 but i'm not (3129B_0023)
really don't know what the problem that day (3129B_0024)
it it the other switch you could be the main switch itself  that turns the lights on or off you know which is on the dashboard (3129B_0025)
 it might be tied into the equation somehow (3129B_0027)
but (3129B_0028)
i know i'm working with the last years there and  usually a special phew that operate the flash your you have a separate fuse for your high i mean i i don't know (3129B_0032)
i should look at that (3129B_0035)
i don't remember seeing on and they  and the (3129B_0036)
i'll have to go back and look at that (3129B_0038)
yeah (3129B_0045)
that's a good idea (3129B_0046)
well i've typically found the ones that  (3129B_0048)
companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not made it after all (3129B_0049)
i hope that that's the case this time (3129B_0050)
right (3129B_0052)
exactly (3129B_0053)
out of  kansas somewhere (3129B_0055)
yeah (3129B_0059)
it's not (3129B_0060)
also got a piece of chrome for the the food that they indicated where's the rap part for this car (3129B_0061)
but  it is not either (3129B_0062)
it's  obviously doesn't quite fit (3129B_0063)
so it must be for a different a year (3129B_0064)
so i'll have to try to return that as well (3129B_0065)
well i had one person that i use for years and years on this (3129B_0068)
and  (3129B_0070)
but it's over like in the district downstairs and you know in what area (3129B_0071)
and i hadn't using for some years (3129B_0075)
last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized (3129B_0076)
set of  all import cars he is narrowed it down to where he only works on  german cars and german cars (3129B_0077)
i'm not sure that he works on much else that (3129B_0079)
he doesn't work i'm british cars anymore and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it (3129B_0080)
so   i might have to check with that person (3129B_0081)
and it turns out that one that shop is near where  now work (3129B_0082)
so  i should be able to take it in and check that part out (3129B_0083)
i've not had to to exchange any other parts recently  because they were defective (3129B_0084)
yeah i've had had pretty good luck (3129B_0085)
just however did  have to get i i  one of these jammed box portable do a cassette players  repaired (3129B_0086)
purchased it at sam's (3129B_0088)
and i'd assumed that it had a ninety they weren't (3129B_0089)
and i should have checked more carefully and and then i better job of saving the receipt (3129B_0090)
because  i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by (3129B_0091)
 some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold him down to get it through recorder comply (3129B_0092)
and it turned out it had a full years war (3129B_0093)
and i could have gotten it repaired for free (3129B_0094)
but i i had to take it in (3129B_0095)
well it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipts and i thought had long since i've been lost (3129B_0099)
 but it didn't do any good 'cause i'd i'd missed a window by about a week or two (3129B_0100)
so i didn't even  yeah i didn't really yeah even bringing up when i went in to pick it up (3129B_0102)
but  that's really my only experience in the past year i've had to take a product back because of the day fact (3129B_0103)
degree (3129B_0114)
 goodness (3129B_0130)
okay (3469A_0000)
what do you think about it (3469A_0001)
yeah (3469A_0007)
i think that's i think it's a little crazy (3469A_0009)
i worked with spanish people for about two years (3469A_0010)
and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers (3469A_0013)
right (3469A_0017)
exactly (3469A_0021)
yeah (3469A_0023)
i think you know i think in a lot of ways a lot of good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states (3469A_0024)
 you're kidding (3469A_0031)
sounds like a lot of fun (3469A_0036)
it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow to occur before you know you could come in (3469A_0038)
right (3469A_0041)
it's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now (3469A_0044)
i think (3469A_0046)
right (3469A_0051)
exactly (3469A_0052)
and i think it's important in a day you know they allow good number of people (3469A_0053)
because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we don't want to do (3469A_0054)
and i just (3469A_0056)
personally i have a problem with it (3469A_0058)
i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that we shouldn't (3469A_0059)
and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when he you know send them back to their country (3469A_0064)
and i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep 'em out that we're spending twice as much money as we would still allowing them (3469A_0066)
yeah (3469A_0069)
and that's that's what i think (3469A_0070)
i i have to laugh (3469A_0071)
because like i said i worked with a lot of those (3469A_0072)
and they had been deported two or three times (3469A_0073)
and just basically they do is they get caught and they wanted to go home for christmas or for any other time (3469A_0074)
but i think you know i think on all there's a lot of improvement (3469A_0080)
i think the general ideas (3469A_0081)
but but there could be some work done in the area (3469A_0082)
well good (3469A_0085)
anyway do you have anything else in the the subject that we might want to talk about (3469A_0087)
yeah (3469A_0094)
absolutely (3469A_0095)
i think a lotta times we take you know basically who we want to (3469A_0096)
because if you if you have connections it's lot easier to get in (3469A_0097)
yeah (3469A_0100)
i think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know and that it should be equal to (3469A_0101)
and not like the united states (3469A_0104)
basically that's not who you know (3469A_0105)
it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are (3469A_0106)
and it should be based on those kinds of things for the good people like probably your husband can get it (3469A_0108)
 great (3469A_0112)
well let's see (3469A_0117)
is there anything else i believe in (3469A_0118)
yeah (3469A_0121)
i'm not sure how long we're supposed to be (3469A_0122)
but i've enjoyed (3469A_0123)
get a hearing your your point of view (3469A_0124)
i think that's (3469A_0125)
i think we agree a lot on that (3469A_0126)
i learned something from it (3469A_0127)
well thanks (3469A_0131)
right (3469A_0132)
good evening all right (3469A_0133)
thanks (3469A_0135)
bye bye (3469A_0136)
immigration (3469B_0002)
i know they're really strict right now because my husband is from out of the country (3469B_0003)
and  we had to go through a whole very long process to  to  sure the government that he was  marrying me and not to be a resident (3469B_0004)
yeah (3469B_0014)
that's true (3469B_0015)
i mean you can't just come over the country because  you want to (3469B_0016)
you know that's not good enough (3469B_0018)
to have it have to have a darn good reason  political or whatever (3469B_0019)
it's not it's not a good easy way to get in (3469B_0022)
exactly (3469B_0025)
my mother  actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men just (3469B_0026)
she never even made  (3469B_0029)
she'd just get money for it (3469B_0030)
so  (3469B_0033)
it was amazing to me how how many exactly (3469B_0039)
but i mean with the new laws it's it's tough (3469B_0040)
exactly (3469B_0045)
well you know yeah my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life (3469B_0047)
and they got here (3469B_0049)
but now it's so you know it's a strict but you can't just (3469B_0050)
i agree (3469B_0055)
exactly (3469B_0060)
if they're not going to be on welfare or whatever (3469B_0062)
they're going to be productive citizen (3469B_0063)
yeah (3469B_0065)
well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been  yeah sent back to mexico just to find a way back (3469B_0068)
that's right (3469B_0075)
that's our money (3469B_0076)
yeah (3469B_0078)
that's true (3469B_0079)
i think (3469B_0084)
anything else in the subject  (3469B_0088)
yeah (3469B_0089)
this is for the moment  (3469B_0091)
but i i don't really see any any changes that i think are fully blatant right now (3469B_0092)
and i think they ought to take it on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a  political refugee (3469B_0093)
exactly (3469B_0098)
connections in money (3469B_0099)
yeah (3469B_0102)
i agree (3469B_0107)
yeah (3469B_0109)
 we got him (3469B_0110)
but (3469B_0111)
that i know there's a lot of other people out there probably do a good job (3469B_0113)
that's that's (3469B_0119)
is this like a very short (3469B_0120)
this (3469B_0128)
well it was nice talking to you (3469B_0130)
you too (3469B_0134)
uh-huh (3469B_0137)
seems to me that one of the reasons that people don't go out to voted maybe they're bored with the whole election process (3520A_0000)
well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference (3520A_0006)
well it's kinda strange (3520A_0011)
in the local elections are the ones that have the most influence on their day to day life (3520A_0012)
my main part of the problem is i don't think they have enough choices (3520A_0022)
you know some of the european countries they have numbers of parties (3520A_0025)
and then a lot of voters come out to vote in in this country (3520A_0026)
maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness (3520A_0032)
well i think part of the problem is election goes on way too long (3520A_0043)
britain you know they have a set period of time (3520A_0044)
and for campaign that (3520A_0045)
this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign (3520A_0046)
well because they don't want to spend the time (3520A_0051)
they don't have the money (3520A_0052)
matter of name recognition (3520A_0059)
people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of (3520A_0060)
and even debates don't seem to help much (3520A_0068)
so really voting for the best make a person in the best handler (3520A_0072)
 that was certainly a media events (3520A_0078)
well he had a classic case up close enough (3520A_0082)
well i agree with the boredom of the election process (3520B_0001)
but i also  think that people don't realize that they're both vote will make a difference (3520B_0002)
 they feel like that you know it's going to go however it's going to go (3520B_0003)
and they're one little boats not going to make that much difference (3520B_0004)
and that's just why make the effort (3520B_0005)
well i agree with that (3520B_0007)
and i and i do know that you know all those votes or county (3520B_0008)
and i do make a difference (3520B_0009)
 also i think that people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote and  the more local elections (3520B_0010)
exactly (3520B_0013)
and  i i even have a tendency to do that myself (3520B_0014)
and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved (3520B_0015)
i live i live in a suburb in the (3520B_0016)
and  so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going on because that directly affects me (3520B_0017)
but  i think on the how most people don't feel that way (3520B_0018)
or don't look at even look at that (3520B_0019)
i think they just don't even (3520B_0020)
i don't think they're conscious of it (3520B_0021)
well that may be true too (3520B_0023)
and thought of that (3520B_0024)
right (3520B_0028)
and sometimes it's  (3520B_0029)
well not sometimes but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign (3520B_0030)
and issues get  bogged down (3520B_0031)
 i think voter awareness (3520B_0033)
i did some work for the women's league of   several years ago (3520B_0034)
and i think there are some organizations that used to  do some voter awareness  things (3520B_0035)
they don't get a lot of participation (3520B_0036)
they don't get a lot of  activity (3520B_0037)
most of the lakers women voters what they did was they put out information so that it it would just be made available to everyone (3520B_0038)
other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates can (3520B_0039)
it would just (3520B_0040)
that was not a lot of community involvement (3520B_0041)
and those are people that would mostly boat anyway (3520B_0042)
it's a it's an ongoing campaign (3520B_0047)
it's expensive campaign (3520B_0048)
it  eliminates a lot of qualified people (3520B_0049)
 maybe more qualified and  more dedicated to the issues (3520B_0050)
exactly (3520B_0053)
exactly (3520B_0054)
yeah (3520B_0055)
i i can't i just can't believe (3520B_0056)
i've worked in a couple of local campaigns (3520B_0057)
i just can't believe the dollars that are just even locally (3520B_0058)
well i agree with that (3520B_0061)
but i also (3520B_0062)
and i and i'm not for controlling how much is spent (3520B_0063)
but do you know (3520B_0064)
that's one thing (3520B_0065)
if the if the time wasn't so (3520B_0066)
if it wasn't such a long  campaigning time then they couldn't spend as much money (3520B_0067)
no (3520B_0069)
they really don't (3520B_0070)
 it's all it's a lot of it is who looks the best who  who happens to say the right thing at the right time who who may not be the most qualified and can get the  the job done (3520B_0071)
exactly (3520B_0073)
and it's  it's a lot (3520B_0074)
i worked in public relations a lot (3520B_0075)
and  that kind of thing can make and bright make or break you (3520B_0076)
you can remember  clinton williams campaign it really was (3520B_0077)
it's just   (3520B_0080)
he possibly could have  one that election had it not been for some of the  the way he presented himself (3520B_0081)
is is i guess the rat term for (3520B_0083)
go ahead (3924A_0001)
aids research is something that that i think the weather our country is putting enough money into it (3924A_0003)
actually i'm concerned that they're not (3924A_0006)
i have a friend who is working with  who works with  travel groups (3924A_0007)
one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an age a conference in  california (3924A_0009)
and these were from other people from other countries (3924A_0011)
a translator (3924A_0012)
and and talking to the people from france he said you know (3924A_0014)
he says one thing that really concerns major government is not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is (3924A_0015)
and they're letting information out slowly about how you know how big it is (3924A_0016)
which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many people get it (3924A_0019)
so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see a spend more (3924A_0020)
i don't know that spending more always gets it (3924A_0021)
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or (3924A_0026)
yeah (3924A_0028)
well (3924A_0038)
i agree with you there (3924A_0039)
because i know everytime that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one (3924A_0040)
and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie (3924A_0041)
money from money for taking care of infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly (3924A_0043)
or do they both get serve (3924A_0044)
that's a good point (3924A_0045)
well in one of the things i (3924A_0057)
and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more (3924A_0058)
that's that's the part (3924A_0061)
that's the part that scares me you know (3924A_0063)
i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals (3924A_0064)
well now (3924A_0065)
sort of homosexuals engaged (3924A_0066)
well no (3924A_0067)
actually it's (3924A_0068)
i mean you know (3924A_0069)
did they know that all along (3924A_0070)
right (3924A_0080)
and how is it really transmitted (3924A_0082)
which is i think what they also don't know (3924A_0085)
 and that's (3924A_0086)
i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know (3924A_0087)
it was nice to isolated to one particular community that they have trouble you know it just to say not approve of anyway (3924A_0089)
but but that didn't how it was in africa (3924A_0090)
in africa with men and women and and had nothing to do with that (3924A_0092)
and it's huge over there (3924A_0093)
so i i you know (3924A_0094)
it's beginning to other countries (3924A_0095)
that was his point (3924A_0096)
this was an international conference where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this (3924A_0097)
does that mean like flu (3924A_0100)
i mean i don't know (3924A_0102)
 i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know (3924A_0103)
or maybe they understand (3924A_0104)
yeah (3924A_0106)
and  and then the people that have it (3924A_0107)
does seem that there are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back (3924A_0108)
if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care (3924A_0109)
you know (3924A_0114)
i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on (3924A_0117)
go ahead (3924A_0121)
exactly (3924A_0123)
yeah (3924A_0126)
and that's i think what they're saying too (3924A_0129)
okay (3924B_0000)
what are we supposed to discuss again (3924B_0002)
more money (3924B_0004)
last     (3924B_0008)
yeah (3924B_0022)
i'm i'm ambivalent about it because   it it will it is very frightening and scary (3924B_0023)
i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases (3924B_0024)
and  i mean whether (3924B_0025)
yes (3924B_0027)
and  whether those diseases can (3924B_0029)
some difference could be made if you did pour more money and like diabetes research (3924B_0030)
yeah yeah (3924B_0034)
but i (3924B_0035)
part of his lack of education (3924B_0036)
i don't know whether whether you know wherever money would be most effectively spam (3924B_0037)
and i'm i am concerned a lot about  i'm concerned about  two things (3924B_0046)
one is preventing a spread (3924B_0047)
and the other is for  for a treaty with illness (3924B_0048)
and i'm not certain (3924B_0050)
i (3924B_0051)
i'm telling you (3924B_0053)
basically i don't have any opinion (3924B_0054)
but whether or not it would be  our money would be better spent  teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems  rather than trying to cure the people already have it (3924B_0056)
yeah (3924B_0059)
yeah (3924B_0060)
whether my dentist or (3924B_0062)
and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitos (3924B_0071)
and you know they've been saying  no absolutely not (3924B_0072)
can't get it from the (3924B_0073)
and and now they're saying well maybe in the right conditions (3924B_0074)
yeah (3924B_0075)
and i don't know that is true or not (3924B_0077)
i just heard it in passing (3924B_0078)
but so what is it (3924B_0079)
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with (3924B_0081)
yeah (3924B_0083)
no (3924B_0091)
i think maybe more information should be given out about it (3924B_0105)
i i give me cyanide (3924B_0110)
exactly (3924B_0120)
and why can't you why can't the fda say you know if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys (3924B_0122)
let 'em do it (3924B_0125)
yeah (3936A_0001)
we haven't had any since   just for christmas (3936A_0002)
and  we got a lot before christmas (3936A_0003)
ski resorts (3936A_0006)
no we haven't we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature version (3936A_0008)
but no  no snow (3936A_0010)
snow's all melted off of mine (3936A_0012)
i guess there's different parts of the state of utah (3936A_0018)
but  (3936A_0019)
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts (3936A_0020)
they're down between thirty eight and forty inches (3936A_0021)
this time of the year (3936A_0023)
and we've been in a drought for the last five years (3936A_0024)
this is a six year (3936A_0025)
and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer (3936A_0026)
right (3936A_0029)
well that's that's a different isn't it (3936A_0035)
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there (3936A_0041)
well i just (3936A_0042)
and we read in the newspapers southern part of texas flooded out (3936A_0043)
my son's in plano he lives pretty close (3936A_0058)
there's quite a wife that goes down a plane (3936A_0059)
and  there's walking trails on both sides are walking path (3936A_0061)
and  when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that (3936A_0062)
 that was clear fall in up to up some of the streets i guess (3936A_0063)
yeah (3936A_0064)
that's funny that we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought they're having too much (3936A_0071)
        yeah (3936A_0076)
interesting (3936A_0077)
i'm going down to el paso next week (3936A_0080)
and  i was wondering what the weather wise (3936A_0081)
i've heard that cold in dallas (3936A_0082)
it's not it doesn't get that cold i guess (3936A_0084)
yes (3936A_0088)
yeah (3936A_0090)
kind of used to that here in utah (3936A_0097)
for a mountain (3936A_0098)
my fly into montana alive (3936A_0099)
we have (3936A_0100)
mountains or really hot (3936A_0102)
and a lot of places we went to you just kind of (3936A_0103)
i sure hope we (3936A_0105)
we really need the moisture (3936A_0106)
i hope we can get  get (3936A_0107)
we're supposed to be a star (3936A_0109)
split run down to  northern arizona in southern utah (3936A_0110)
and they're not predicting any for the next week anyway up here (3936A_0111)
yeah (3936A_0112)
yeah (3936A_0115)
what's that (3936A_0116)
above (3936A_0118)
some of them went to the south or some of the north i've been to montana (3936A_0119)
so i just left (3936A_0120)
we've got a high pressure system is just been sitting in there (3936A_0121)
and  we broke the record for the amount of far that we've had man (3936A_0124)
  deal about noon every day (3936A_0126)
they see the clouds seemed to farm to try to get the airplane in and out     (3936A_0127)
have you had any snow up your way (3936B_0000)
well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills  mountains in  utah guesses last weekend (3936B_0013)
and she had  quite a bit of snow on the ground her way (3936B_0016)
yeah (3936B_0027)
well the weather here is always a topic of conversation in texas (3936B_0028)
but  we have wide variation and have warm weather when most people have cold weather (3936B_0030)
but we have our share of cold weather as well (3936B_0031)
temperature this morning was right at freezing (3936B_0032)
and didn't stay there (3936B_0033)
but it was right (3936B_0034)
we usually have summer coldest weather toward the end of january (3936B_0038)
but this year it wasn't bad at all (3936B_0039)
i guess that's because we had so much rain (3936B_0040)
 yeah (3936B_0044)
well my  my sister lives in houston (3936B_0047)
and i  the river there was  in the flooding staged near where her son lives (3936B_0048)
and that  cause some a concern of course (3936B_0051)
they have a a lake cabin (3936B_0053)
and  they're completely under water on the lake (3936B_0054)
 we really had a lot of rain (3936B_0057)
right (3936B_0060)
yeah (3936B_0065)
we had a lot of flash floods in the area (3936B_0066)
we had a few people who ran into water and a few fatalities  just to (3936B_0067)
not more than ten (3936B_0069)
uh-huh (3936B_0070)
well a a there's no profane expression about texas weather (3936B_0072)
it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy (3936B_0075)
well al paso won't be cold (3936B_0083)
yeah (3936B_0085)
it's it's quite southern (3936B_0086)
and it's it's rare to get real cold and you know pass (3936B_0087)
yeah you'll be flying in there (3936B_0089)
well  take off it was a fun from el paso because she normally (3936B_0091)
the way the wind sorry you take off right toward the mountain the rockies (3936B_0092)
in their towering about (3936B_0094)
and so you circle back over there and then like a circle around and come back over again (3936B_0095)
well (3936B_0108)
well i noticed on the weather map on  cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving in the california known down your way (3936B_0113)
but i guess it didn't pan out (3936B_0114)
yeah (3936B_0125)
well we  had a bad seed last  christmas a year ago (3936B_0131)
we went up to visit my wife's a sister who lives in  calgary alberta (3936B_0134)
okay (3968A_0000)
i know (3968A_0004)
i guess it i guess you consider just things that everyday that would you would think (3968A_0005)
see i'm a college student (3968A_0006)
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know that i think so i can invasion of my privacy stuff like that (3968A_0007)
but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic (3968A_0010)
 god (3968A_0021)
right now (3968A_0022)
yeah (3968A_0028)
call late (3968A_0030)
now i mean now there's i heard that they are going to start calling on saturdays or so (3968A_0031)
see that's  (3968A_0033)
i'd be so mad (3968A_0034)
really (3968A_0037)
really (3968A_0044)
 no (3968A_0047)
think like things that (3968A_0048)
things like privacy like just like not going through my step but like going through just like my clothes and my just going through my stuff basically (3968A_0049)
that drives me up a wall (3968A_0051)
no (3968A_0053)
we're not (3968A_0054)
and  (3968A_0055)
yeah (3968A_0057)
she'll take all my shirts and stuff (3968A_0058)
'cause she can't wear like my pants (3968A_0059)
which will take all my shirts in my classes and stuff (3968A_0061)
i'm just glad that way my dresses you know (3968A_0063)
but still yeah so the steak (3968A_0065)
she won't even think about it (3968A_0066)
and then i like seeing that (3968A_0067)
we were not close (3968A_0068)
i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes that you know (3968A_0069)
really (3968A_0070)
so i prefer that you just not going to get them (3968A_0071)
cause she didn't even ask me (3968A_0075)
stuff like that or (3968A_0076)
that's an invasion of my privacy i feel like (3968A_0077)
stuff like that (3968A_0080)
when you have your door close people just walking in and stuff like that (3968A_0081)
i was thinking like my mom (3968A_0083)
she would think this is like an invasion of privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff (3968A_0085)
just give her her you know (3968A_0087)
she'll get it out or whatever (3968A_0088)
sure (3968A_0092)
and that's the only they could really think of that would really be (3968A_0093)
really (3968A_0095)
yeah (3968A_0101)
a cabinet (3968A_0102)
that's great (3968A_0105)
see (3968A_0115)
yeah (3968A_0117)
yeah (3968A_0120)
you know you put your stuff where it's (3968A_0121)
yeah (3968A_0123)
that would drive that one (3968A_0124)
really (3968A_0126)
yeah (3968A_0141)
then you start missing stuff (3968A_0143)
and (3968A_0144)
okay (3968A_0149)
see that would that and that you really (3968A_0150)
she can always tell when someone's touched your stuff (3968A_0151)
'cause (3968A_0152)
i know i have everything like a certain way (3968A_0153)
and you know how it looks and everything (3968A_0155)
that would bother me definitely (3968A_0159)
see (3968A_0168)
yeah (3968A_0169)
you know (3968A_0171)
so i can really think of that'd be an invasion of privacy like something every day though (3968A_0172)
 really (3968A_0179)
right (3968B_0001)
that's a real different topic (3968B_0002)
i'm not sure i'm familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy (3968B_0003)
yeah (3968B_0008)
yeah (3968B_0011)
i think personally (3968B_0013)
i'm used to be a college student uh-huh and years ago (3968B_0014)
but  now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone uh-huh and says mrs miller have we gotta deal for you (3968B_0018)
it's like how do you know my name (3968B_0023)
where did you get my phone number (3968B_0024)
and  why do you think it's a deal for me (3968B_0025)
because people will call you anytime of the day or night with try to solicit (3968B_0027)
an invasion of my privacy i think (3968B_0029)
 they do already (3968B_0032)
i've even had the computer generated calls on sundays too (3968B_0036)
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated call (3968B_0040)
yeah don't answer your phone hello (3968B_0042)
the computers are geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello (3968B_0043)
 yeah (3968B_0050)
are you in your room mate is similar size (3968B_0052)
she still goes through your clothes (3968B_0056)
yeah (3968B_0062)
yeah (3968B_0064)
 yeah (3968B_0078)
i agree (3968B_0079)
 yeah (3968B_0086)
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinet (3968B_0094)
i mean we're all grown (3968B_0096)
her kids are grown (3968B_0097)
we have our own families (3968B_0098)
and now if we go through her cabinet she's like well what are you digging for (3968B_0100)
like what are you doing (3968B_0103)
yes (3968B_0106)
so i guess privacy is really (3968B_0107)
the workplace i suppose (3968B_0108)
 well actually yeah (3968B_0109)
i can say definitely then privacy at the workplace (3968B_0110)
hated for people to open up my drawer see to my desk (3968B_0114)
that was that was where i kept all my stuff (3968B_0118)
and i could tell you what your turn on the wrong way (3968B_0119)
yeah that would that would that would drive it drove me batty for (3968B_0125)
yeah (3968B_0127)
well i worked  second shift (3968B_0128)
and everybody else in my area worked first shift (3968B_0130)
shifts overlapped (3968B_0132)
so i would come in (3968B_0134)
there would be people sitting at my desk working (3968B_0135)
and i'm wondering you know  what is it (3968B_0136)
it's  my vitamins (3968B_0137)
i wonder what is yeah yeah what is (3968B_0138)
are they working at my desk (3968B_0139)
can i have it back (3968B_0140)
and had it makes soon (3968B_0142)
yeah (3968B_0145)
know mommy's going to take the vitamins (3968B_0146)
i'm sorry (3968B_0147)
see that would that that you know you can always tell someone that's your step kids i mean i know i have everything like assert awkward call and you know how it looks and everything  yeah (3968B_0156)
but you know how you left at the day before (3968B_0157)
yeah (3968B_0160)
so that's (3968B_0161)
yeah (3968B_0162)
i agree (3968B_0163)
it's it's pretty that way (3968B_0164)
and i know even like with your school books and paper (3968B_0165)
you miss your paper sometimes (3968B_0167)
yeah (3968B_0173)
well actually i do now (3968B_0174)
i have used it once (3968B_0175)
and it it really is an invasion of privacy (3968B_0177)
in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are five where they live at any rate address (3968B_0178)
yeah (3968B_0180)
and that (3968B_0182)
i mean i've i've used it once (3968B_0183)
okay (4002A_0001)
 well yeah (4002A_0003)
for the last a couple of months (4002A_0004)
yeah (4002A_0007)
well it's kinda hard to say (4002A_0009)
 'cause i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years (4002A_0010)
okay but  a car  last year and then bought one in eighty nine (4002A_0011)
and  (4002A_0015)
right (4002A_0016)
we bought one in ninety (4002A_0017)
about three cars of all things (4002A_0018)
so  probably will be in at least a mid size four doors today (4002A_0020)
 we have a a must and then twenty nine and a forward crown victoria and a little two seater c r a x (4002A_0023)
 it's a difficult to to reject what kind of  (4002A_0025)
look always look into a consumer reports to see what kind of a report or  repair records that the various cars had (4002A_0026)
and then of course we look into the prices (4002A_0028)
and   we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars to get to be discount (4002A_0030)
cause we keep we've began to keep them a long a longer period of time (4002A_0031)
i tried it often an eighty two oldsmobile for the eighty nine months (4002A_0032)
so  (4002A_0034)
yeah (4002A_0036)
yeah (4002A_0037)
we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life (4002A_0038)
 we've had a good many foreign cars (4002A_0039)
and  that that  (4002A_0041)
i've been extremely (4002A_0042)
we've had three months (4002A_0043)
we've been extremely pleased with their money (4002A_0044)
yeah (4002A_0046)
yeah (4002A_0048)
well we we've had (4002A_0049)
let's see (4002A_0050)
we had  we had a  (4002A_0051)
anything (4002A_0052)
we had a fifty three (4002A_0053)
and   we had  two fifty three which is a long thirty minutes story (4002A_0054)
 i only had a sixty five (4002A_0056)
and then we had this eighty two (4002A_0057)
so we can't complain about oldsmobile really (4002A_0059)
yeah (4002A_0063)
well (4002A_0080)
 my son over in shreveport  sold volkswagen's for ten years (4002A_0082)
and that was one of the deciding factor thing getting them  (4002A_0083)
 so  the first foreign car that we had was   seventy seven m g n g e bay (4002A_0085)
british racing green with and a hard top and a soft (4002A_0087)
and  i drove it mostly (4002A_0089)
yeah (4002A_0093)
really was (4002A_0094)
my husband was in the air force (4002A_0095)
and we got transferred okinawa (4002A_0096)
so  we had the salad (4002A_0098)
which was really (4002A_0099)
because  it was it was great fun (4002A_0101)
and then  when we got to okinawa wow we bought a second hand (4002A_0102)
 we decided that (4002A_0103)
that's  sixty five oldsmobile (4002A_0104)
and and it was just too big (4002A_0105)
so we we sold it to the fella who was coming back to the states (4002A_0106)
we got a little fit and and and a little  forty horse power must of four dollars a day (4002A_0107)
okay (4002B_0000)
have you done this very long (4002B_0002)
yeah (4002B_0005)
that's the same with us (4002B_0006)
well what kind of car would you buy (4002B_0008)
 okay (4002B_0012)
okay (4002B_0021)
what kind do you have now (4002B_0022)
 okay (4002B_0024)
yeah (4002B_0029)
did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic (4002B_0035)
 really (4002B_0045)
we've always spot american made cars mostly oldsmobile (4002B_0047)
we've been real pleased with us (4002B_0061)
i think we've had one two three (4002B_0062)
and most (4002B_0064)
we have a well we still have a supreme which is like seventy seven (4002B_0065)
we have a (4002B_0067)
we've had a ninety eight (4002B_0068)
yeah (4002B_0070)
but i don't know (4002B_0071)
will work and to be in the market for a car probably in the next year (4002B_0072)
and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they give good financing through the the motor company (4002B_0073)
but i don't know what we're going to buy (4002B_0077)
i always thought i would like to try foreign may (4002B_0078)
but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty (4002B_0079)
so (4002B_0081)
 that (4002B_0086)
 boy (4002B_0088)
but it was hard to part with that (4002B_0090)
 yes (4002B_0100)
so what do you think about caring for older folks scale (4102A_0000)
right (4102A_0005)
very definitely (4102A_0007)
well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents are starting to get all (4102A_0011)
they aren't really that old (4102A_0012)
but they're sort of wearing out (4102A_0013)
my mom has a dialysis patient (4102A_0014)
and she's only about sixty four (4102A_0016)
but she's had some pretty close calls (4102A_0017)
and my dad he has to drive or to a dialysis now (4102A_0018)
and so she stays in (4102A_0019)
and but she's also a very very very independent person and doesn't like having having people  not being able to do things for ourself when she wants to (4102A_0020)
 i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home (4102A_0022)
so my dad he keeps talking about it (4102A_0023)
i couldn't possibly could never see him in a nursing home (4102A_0025)
and my grandad he also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home (4102A_0029)
he's ninety i think right on ninety right now (4102A_0030)
and he's living by himself (4102A_0032)
my grandma died a couple of years ago (4102A_0033)
so but he's (4102A_0035)
as long as you can have the families take care of the people i like to see 'em stay at home (4102A_0036)
right (4102A_0044)
right (4102A_0047)
right (4102A_0053)
especially for your uncle have there (4102A_0054)
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult daycare program for mostly for patience with all palmer's (4102A_0057)
do they have anything like that in dallas (4102A_0058)
right (4102A_0064)
so they're pretty limited (4102A_0065)
 another interesting thing (4102A_0067)
another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had  sort of kept him in the pants to make 'em take care of their older relatives to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities (4102A_0068)
i don't think that was mainly with all timers patients but just patients in job people in general or not as independent as they used to be (4102A_0072)
 right (4102A_0078)
 right (4102A_0082)
too (4102A_0084)
to get there and to participate in the activity (4102A_0085)
right (4102A_0089)
right (4102A_0091)
that's true (4102A_0093)
can't play those things (4102A_0094)
but you can sing songs and  tell stories about the old time (4102A_0097)
yes you're now you're talking about your (4102A_0100)
what is it your grandmother that with having alzheimer's  being able to tell old stories (4102A_0101)
you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with all palmer's talking about the old times and enjoying themselves that way (4102A_0106)
do they like to listen to other people recollect (4102A_0111)
right (4102A_0116)
well that is good because (4102A_0119)
well i think  the elderly it's a really neat population to care for (4102B_0001)
they've got a lot of special needs (4102B_0003)
and at the same time  majority of 'em don't want to give up the independence that they have (4102B_0004)
so you've got a real balance to make their (4102B_0008)
what about you (4102B_0010)
 really (4102B_0031)
 okay (4102B_0034)
yeah (4102B_0037)
but it gets hard (4102B_0038)
my my grandmother is in her mid eighties (4102B_0039)
and she's  suffering from  well a progressive alzheimer's disease (4102B_0041)
so she doesn't remember anybody (4102B_0043)
and  she remembers things (4102B_0045)
but there are things back whenever she was real young (4102B_0046)
and so with (4102B_0048)
she was living by yourself (4102B_0049)
but my  uncle has moved in with her to take care of her (4102B_0050)
it's creating a lot of problem (4102B_0052)
yes (4102B_0055)
yes (4102B_0056)
in dallas (4102B_0059)
 yeah (4102B_0060)
i've i've heard of several things (4102B_0061)
and they're really neat program is to be able to do if you can link up with  (4102B_0062)
but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get the men or  to be able to get them there and the for the day program and pick them up (4102B_0063)
right (4102B_0066)
 really (4102B_0069)
well it's it's it's a really daycare programs are really neat you know (4102B_0075)
and if if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do (4102B_0076)
but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them (4102B_0077)
and i think that's in a way somewhere some an area where some of the daycare  programs have left off (4102B_0081)
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do though (4102B_0083)
right (4102B_0086)
cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in dallas (4102B_0087)
 and they have ceramics and pottery and needlework and sports (4102B_0088)
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis for badly (4102B_0092)
yeah (4102B_0095)
you can't do it (4102B_0096)
well that's true (4102B_0098)
and they love to recollect (4102B_0107)
i mean they just you know (4102B_0108)
and they'll just to go on and on with these stores (4102B_0109)
and they have such a memory (4102B_0110)
my grandmother died (4102B_0112)
she would she wants to to to tell you about her story over again (4102B_0114)
which is fine you know (4102B_0117)
yeah (4102B_0118)
 so what do you think (4157A_0000)
right (4157A_0010)
right (4157A_0013)
 really (4157A_0017)
 also another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was  go down all these rules houses and they were real healthy or tell tells us  together is is like lower middle class housing what would be lower middle class housing here it's uh-huh (4157A_0022)
right (4157A_0040)
right (4157A_0042)
yeah (4157A_0048)
i (4157A_0050)
that is that is something i've heard (4157A_0051)
i had a friend  that i worked with that was from sweden (4157A_0052)
and that was (4157A_0053)
probably the the major concern i have is that you know we are leading and the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into  the medical field (4157A_0054)
but at the same time  it's real hard (4157A_0055)
i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance (4157A_0056)
so yeah i'm real yeah (4157A_0057)
it's like well you know (4157A_0058)
there's got to be better ways you know to do some things (4157A_0059)
but you know i hate to (4157A_0060)
the the competition in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor (4157A_0061)
and and  they have to compete to be to be good to be knowledgeable (4157A_0062)
but at the same time there's  you know they're regulating themselves (4157A_0063)
and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for (4157A_0064)
i have a brother who's a vet (4157A_0065)
and for something that he can get you know (4157A_0066)
i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper 'cause they they hospitals by untouchable great  (4157A_0067)
you know they can charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty items (4157A_0069)
and that's ridiculous (4157A_0070)
and i don't think that is that is  abnormal in any means to be doing things like that (4157A_0071)
and (4157A_0072)
i don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all (4157A_0074)
it (4157A_0078)
yeah (4157A_0079)
and so it's i think i to me i think something that's going to help our medical  arena is for  (4157A_0080)
and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this (4157A_0081)
but i think people are too lawsuit happy (4157A_0082)
and i mean things will happen (4157A_0083)
and you've got to  keep up (4157A_0084)
or you've got to realize that you know it is just men or women that are that are making  decision (4157A_0085)
and they will make mistakes (4157A_0086)
and you know people you know (4157A_0087)
there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it (4157A_0088)
but there are other things that just happened that you can't you know you can't say you know what if he had just done this you know things would have done differently (4157A_0089)
and  i don't know (4157A_0090)
i think the fact that it malpractice has gone up i think is raised our prices just dramatically  in the in the last number of years (4157A_0091)
and i think that's something that if if they could work on the cause of that and (4157A_0094)
i i lived in sweden for two years (4157B_0003)
in in sweden they have socialized medicine (4157B_0005)
and so i saw some of the good (4157B_0006)
and also i saw some of the bad the results from such a program (4157B_0007)
 some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about healthcare (4157B_0009)
so it's a very very  comfortable (4157B_0011)
i mean there are people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency if it's going to make your destitute for life (4157B_0012)
 the bad was more parent i think at least for me (4157B_0014)
because i think it affected people's lives in a way that you could see (4157B_0015)
one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be an alcoholic and so we (4157B_0016)
because it's treated as a disease (4157B_0018)
no i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine (4157B_0019)
but  if you're if you're an alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long term disability (4157B_0020)
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that (4157B_0021)
also  another thing that that i noticed that was very strange (4157B_0023)
it was  i would go down all these  (4157B_0024)
i remember this one row of houses (4157B_0025)
and they were  row houses are townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle class housing (4157B_0026)
what would be lower middle class housing here (4157B_0029)
probably middle class housing there (4157B_0030)
 and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these (4157B_0032)
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these (4157B_0033)
one guy was (4157B_0034)
and it's a taxi driver (4157B_0035)
so they're they're incomes were about the same (4157B_0037)
whereas here there's great incentive to be a doctor because there is a great financial reward (4157B_0039)
and that that didn't exist in sweden (4157B_0041)
and  overall i get their their healthcare suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower (4157B_0043)
it was it was less professional (4157B_0044)
and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type of job than  than a doctor type job (4157B_0045)
right (4157B_0068)
you don't think it's abnormal (4157B_0073)
 i (4157B_0075)
not saying it's right (4157B_0076)
you're just saying it's common (4157B_0077)
yes (4157B_0092)
yes (4167A_0000)
i'll start off here (4167A_0001)
 i don't (4167A_0002)
probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from cnn  (4167A_0003)
 i like cnn because that  you know repeats (4167A_0004)
well headline news repeats every half hour (4167A_0005)
and  it makes it really convenient 'cause i keep a rather hectic schedule (4167A_0006)
and (4167A_0010)
but the newspaper provides a little bit of death but you can't really get from (4167A_0011)
right (4167A_0020)
right (4167A_0025)
yeah (4167A_0026)
i don't know that (4167A_0027)
my only major objection is that  i don't think american media spins enough  attention on on our closest neighbor's like mexico and canada (4167A_0028)
yeah (4167A_0033)
right (4167A_0035)
yeah (4167A_0036)
i mean you know canada's gone through a lot of problems now what's it called back and and everything (4167A_0037)
and  it's amazing that (4167A_0038)
you know i i listen to the dc area and the washington post (4167A_0039)
i mean the most they'll give it as maybe the back of the a section (4167A_0040)
 you know (4167A_0042)
yeah (4167A_0054)
definitely (4167A_0055)
yeah (4167A_0057)
right (4167A_0070)
right (4167A_0075)
exactly (4167A_0076)
yeah (4167A_0077)
i  spent this past summer up in canada (4167A_0078)
 well part of it touring (4167A_0079)
and  yeah i was amazed because i'd pick up a local paper and i had read about all these you know really interesting things going on (4167A_0080)
there's some serious talk about whether there is actually going to be  like canada you know and the next five years you know because of the problems with (4167A_0081)
and i had never heard any of that before (4167A_0084)
right (4167A_0096)
 yeah (4167A_0108)
 yeah (4167A_0114)
i guess i've never seen that tv show (4167A_0122)
i used to get the  (4167A_0123)
right (4167B_0007)
yeah (4167B_0008)
yeah (4167B_0012)
 i think i agree (4167B_0014)
  similar method of getting the news with me too (4167B_0015)
  cnn it's been a welcome addition to the tv  seen here in the last the number of years (4167B_0016)
prior to cable you know you didn't get my news off of normal  television broadcasts (4167B_0019)
 just usually pretty local in in nature (4167B_0021)
and i like  cnn because you get some world world events too  which is not to comment on the other format newspapers and so forth (4167B_0022)
that's true (4167B_0030)
hardly ever see a headline articles about the  either economics or or or the news events going on in either of those countries (4167B_0031)
and whereas if you pick up a european paper and just all of a surrounding countries the soviet union everything has a major news  articles in them (4167B_0034)
yeah (4167B_0041)
i'm currently living in dallas (4167B_0043)
and it it won't even give it to (4167B_0044)
never see you never see anything about it (4167B_0045)
 which is a shame because you go to other countries (4167B_0048)
and and they carry quite a bit about the us on the other hand (4167B_0049)
if you go up to  canada those people are usually pretty  familiar with the politics going on and on the news and it's in the us and (4167B_0050)
and we're pretty  limited and our understanding of of leaders that in canada or mexico (4167B_0053)
definitely you just don't know what's going on (4167B_0056)
i (4167B_0058)
every once in a while i have to travel overseas (4167B_0059)
lately i have taken that taking a little short wave radio  around and picking up the bbc (4167B_0060)
sort of like   cnn too (4167B_0061)
can you can tune into some stations (4167B_0062)
and you get some like thirty minute some raises  news events (4167B_0065)
 occasionally go to some of the middle eastern area (4167B_0066)
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all (4167B_0067)
not much in a way of television and some of those places (4167B_0069)
 but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries (4167B_0072)
i hadn't really thought about it (4167B_0073)
but i guess you don't think about it 'cause you don't hear it (4167B_0074)
yeah you know because of the problems with back and i had never (4167B_0082)
you know there was  (4167B_0086)
what is it called (4167B_0087)
like a court (4167B_0088)
yeah that's just something i i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never hurt (4167B_0090)
and i think i heard of it by the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a  a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it (4167B_0091)
in in (4167B_0092)
and it was a big thing going on there (4167B_0093)
and i came back here (4167B_0094)
nothing in the papers (4167B_0095)
right and see the thing about it (4167B_0098)
so it's so we've got a long ways to go i guess (4167B_0099)
improve (4167B_0100)
and like i say with cnn and and  the cable news (4167B_0101)
even there's  (4167B_0102)
it's sort of semi religious in some respects (4167B_0103)
but what is it (4167B_0104)
 i mean this news is not not that way (4167B_0105)
 i'm trying to think of the channels (4167B_0106)
the christian science monitor (4167B_0107)
 it surprised me (4167B_0109)
quite a few times (4167B_0110)
and they they do some pretty good news (4167B_0111)
 seemingly unbiased news broadcasts (4167B_0112)
 the title of the network is sort of surprised (4167B_0113)
you think you'd carry must be religious (4167B_0116)
but it it doesn't seem to (4167B_0117)
i'll flip through and and listen to at once in a while to  in case something maybe a little different than than cnn might be covering (4167B_0118)
 some more interest type topics in other countries (4167B_0119)
but it's kind of a world world  network too (4167B_0120)
a a golden retriever (4179A_0000)
yeah (4179A_0002)
really (4179A_0004)
we've had him for (4179A_0006)
let's see he just had his fourth birthday (4179A_0007)
yeah (4179A_0009)
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old (4179A_0010)
and  he's pretty okay (4179A_0011)
we like (4179A_0012)
he does (4179A_0014)
that's the one thing we don't like about it (4179A_0015)
fact we threaten them in the summer time that we might just save all of his hair off (4179A_0016)
you'd probably look pretty funny if we did that (4179A_0018)
he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything (4179A_0020)
and they put them on the scale (4179A_0021)
he was up to ninety four now (4179A_0022)
but he's not a real it's not a real tall  dog for a golden retriever (4179A_0024)
he's kind of stocky shorter and stock (4179A_0025)
he is (4179A_0029)
it's just me and my wife (4179A_0030)
and  he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids (4179A_0031)
we turn him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten (4179A_0033)
cause i (4179A_0036)
you can get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids (4179A_0039)
how 'bout you (4179A_0041)
yeah (4179A_0047)
that's probably a good idea (4179A_0050)
they're good though (4179A_0051)
have you ever had to retrieve it before (4179A_0052)
cause i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs (4179A_0055)
they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial (4179A_0056)
they like to play (4179A_0057)
especially with kids (4179A_0059)
they love to play with kids (4179A_0060)
 no (4179A_0062)
he's pretty much an inside dog (4179A_0063)
he stays in (4179A_0065)
we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i want him to be out too much (4179A_0066)
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside (4179A_0067)
he's really a whim (4179A_0069)
and when it comes to being alone (4179A_0071)
now if you give them the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that (4179A_0072)
but he does not like to be tied outside (4179A_0073)
he'll he'll just bark and bark and bars (4179A_0074)
now (4179A_0076)
he's  take him to the training pretty well (4179A_0077)
and  he knows where our yard is (4179A_0078)
and we have a pretty small (4179A_0079)
he seems to know the boundaries (4179A_0080)
and he usually is good about staying within (4179A_0082)
our next door neighbors have a dog too (4179A_0083)
and  she she is good friends with my dog (4179A_0084)
and so he often gets to smelling her son and we'll go over there to stick around and stuff (4179A_0086)
but he's pretty (4179A_0087)
he stays out of the street (4179A_0090)
and  if i catch them like calling (4179A_0091)
and he comes back (4179A_0092)
so he he's pretty good about taking to command and things (4179A_0093)
you know (4179A_0097)
we never did (4179A_0099)
i'd i'd train 'em on my own (4179A_0102)
and  this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult (4179A_0103)
we've had kids we've had dogs when i was a kid (4179A_0105)
but this the first one that i  tokyo (4179A_0106)
so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time (4179A_0107)
but  he he seems to have picked it up pretty well (4179A_0108)
i never really had to hit them or anything (4179A_0109)
just you know from tone of voice and those sorts of things (4179A_0112)
i see other people out there (4179A_0117)
and they hit their dogs and try to (4179A_0118)
and and those horrible callers that they put on within vince invisible fencing (4179A_0119)
invisible fence (4179A_0122)
have you heard of that (4179A_0123)
it's  it's a system you can put in your yard for you barry these little  transducers or in your yard and the perimeter (4179A_0126)
and then they were color with a special little attachment on it (4179A_0129)
and if they get too close to that perimeter it (4179A_0130)
yeah (4179A_0134)
yeah (4179A_0136)
yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog (4179A_0137)
he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog (4179A_0138)
so he held on to the call (4179A_0139)
and he walked out to the premise (4179A_0140)
he said it was a good jolt (4179A_0141)
yeah (4179A_0143)
so i i don't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques (4179A_0144)
i don't think they're always necessary (4179A_0147)
put enough patience and too (4179A_0148)
it's  is your cat an indoor cat or an hour (4179A_0154)
somebody just tommy (4179A_0158)
because of the leukemia (4179A_0160)
wow (4179A_0164)
quite a difference (4179A_0166)
what  what kind of climate to you have (4179A_0168)
that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs (4179B_0001)
how long have you had it (4179B_0005)
fourth birthday (4179B_0008)
does he shut a lot (4179B_0013)
how much does he way now (4179B_0019)
is he good with family (4179B_0028)
yeah (4179B_0034)
can understand that (4179B_0035)
we have a cat who is also about four years old (4179B_0042)
and he's our spoiled child right now too (4179B_0044)
and he also sheds a lot (4179B_0046)
but we  we hope to get a golden retriever some day (4179B_0048)
but we figure we'll get the kids and then the dog (4179B_0049)
yeah (4179B_0053)
but my husband had one when he was growing up (4179B_0054)
it is your dog an inside and out (4179B_0061)
 really (4179B_0068)
when he gets outside just and does he run away and then eventually come back (4179B_0075)
no he's  taking the training pretty well and  he knows where our yard is pretty small european seems to know the boundaries (4179B_0081)
yeah (4179B_0085)
did you bring him to doggie obedience school or no to train him on your own (4179B_0096)
invisible what (4179B_0121)
what is that (4179B_0125)
boy (4179B_0133)
i'd be afraid to walk around assignments that dog (4179B_0135)
really (4179B_0142)
yeah (4179B_0149)
just be consistent and diligent with it (4179B_0150)
yeah (4179B_0155)
he's indoor and all the clawed because i know the average lifespan of an outdoor cat is eighteen months (4179B_0157)
yeah (4179B_0159)
yeah (4179B_0161)
that and also just  getting hit i guess are getting beat up (4179B_0162)
and the average lifespan of an indoor cat is eighteen years (4179B_0163)
so (4179B_0165)
yeah (4179B_0167)
well  it's we just moved recently (4179B_0169)
so now we're in the  dallas area (4179B_0170)
it's very very nice (4179B_0171)
the only experience i have (4384A_0000)
i don't have any children (4384A_0001)
but i've  i was a babysitter in high school (4384A_0002)
and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist well she works (4384A_0003)
and i just  (4384A_0004)
 yeah (4384A_0010)
expense (4384A_0011)
to sit around (4384A_0018)
that's true (4384A_0019)
see the lady i did it for (4384A_0023)
that's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up (4384A_0024)
so she could sleep in (4384A_0025)
and  then she could be at home (4384A_0026)
then i'd brand to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted to or whatever (4384A_0027)
but  she paid i think it was two years it was about two fifty three dollars an hour (4384A_0028)
and by the time i pay taxes on it i was getting like eighty cents (4384A_0029)
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything (4384A_0030)
yeah (4384A_0035)
right (4384A_0043)
 wow (4384A_0052)
wow (4384A_0064)
yeah (4384A_0069)
i think people that treat their babysitter like that get a lot better babysitters (4384A_0071)
and they stick around for longer (4384A_0074)
because i mean after i figure it out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said back (4384A_0075)
you know (4384A_0076)
just like i'm wasting my time (4384A_0078)
and i really liked the little girl and everything (4384A_0080)
but i (4384A_0081)
yeah (4384A_0085)
yeah (4384A_0086)
well and she was really spoiled (4384A_0091)
they didn't make or eat anything she didn't want or anything (4384A_0092)
so basically they fed or cookies for breakfast and lunch (4384A_0093)
and the mom was a dead (4384A_0095)
i was just like we've gotta quit this (4384A_0096)
she's like no i don't want her to stop (4384A_0097)
but i don't want to make her eight something she doesn't want to eat (4384A_0098)
yeah (4384A_0101)
eat this or (4384A_0103)
i can see that concerns on what different people one (4384A_0106)
because  (4384A_0108)
no five setting up a daycare there'd be so many needs you'd have to customize or service too (4384A_0109)
some parents won't put up with anything where others (4384A_0113)
no (4384A_0120)
that's true (4384A_0123)
i'd love to do it (4384A_0124)
but i just don't trust people now (4384A_0125)
there's too many lawsuits (4384A_0126)
i just i think it's a bigger risk then (4384A_0128)
yeah (4384A_0130)
would scare me (4384A_0132)
i don't know (4384A_0134)
cause i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue (4384A_0135)
but i think a lot of them are just you know they're negligence (4384A_0136)
and they get happy about money (4384A_0137)
and they just want to see (4384A_0138)
 yeah (4384A_0148)
pasta (4384A_0151)
i have a girlfriend that works at a daycare (4384A_0154)
and she takes her little girl with (4384A_0155)
and i mean she tells me about half the people that they hire (4384A_0156)
and half of 'em she'd like to turn them into the state (4384A_0157)
the people that are working there you know (4384A_0158)
and then she'd like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition that kids are in you know (4384A_0159)
they'll be in the same calls they were the day before the same diaper (4384A_0161)
you know just awful thing (4384A_0163)
and so i don't know (4384A_0164)
i don't have kids (4384A_0165)
but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody (4384A_0166)
i mean you just don't know (4384A_0167)
yeah (4384A_0176)
that's true (4384A_0177)
yeah (4384A_0179)
district me apart i think (4384A_0181)
i don't know (4384A_0182)
not knowing (4384A_0184)
yeah (4384B_0005)
that's the only thing i've ever done also is babysit (4384B_0006)
but  i've heard people that i work with talk about you know (4384B_0008)
especially i guess it's even harder on single mothers (4384B_0009)
yeah (4384B_0012)
having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock (4384B_0013)
it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff like that (4384B_0014)
which is understanding (4384B_0016)
and these people can't you know stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late (4384B_0017)
but (4384B_0021)
yeah (4384B_0031)
it's hardly worth your time (4384B_0034)
yeah (4384B_0036)
that's pretty bad (4384B_0037)
only time i babysat was in high school (4384B_0038)
and it was (4384B_0039)
of course you don't have (4384B_0040)
and and pay taxes on that (4384B_0041)
uh-huh (4384B_0042)
it was easy you know go over to some (4384B_0044)
these people that lived in our neighborhood (4384B_0045)
and i'll just go over there (4384B_0046)
every thursday night and i went to the theater (4384B_0047)
they had permanent ticket (4384B_0048)
and they give me (4384B_0049)
two dollars an hour for two kids (4384B_0050)
but they usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night (4384B_0051)
and i mean (4384B_0053)
it was great (4384B_0054)
go over there (4384B_0055)
it'd be like  you know there's we had these videos over here (4384B_0056)
watch whatever you want (4384B_0057)
and there's some and the and the coverage (4384B_0060)
and there's some code (4384B_0061)
you know just help yourself to anything (4384B_0062)
so it was it was you know but that's (4384B_0063)
that was a long time ago (4384B_0066)
and that was only for a few years (4384B_0067)
just once a week (4384B_0068)
but i don't know (4384B_0070)
yeah (4384B_0072)
that is true (4384B_0073)
yeah (4384B_0077)
yeah (4384B_0079)
she does take up (4384B_0082)
they do take up a lot of your time (4384B_0083)
and (4384B_0084)
a very demanding (4384B_0088)
uh-huh (4384B_0099)
my mom would be like  you did or don't eat anything (4384B_0100)
right (4384B_0105)
yeah (4384B_0107)
yeah (4384B_0110)
i think the best way to go and just be to be able to do it out of your basement (4384B_0116)
just have like at the most like ten kids (4384B_0118)
all from maybe people that you know type of thing (4384B_0119)
instead of trying to actually set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in (4384B_0122)
yeah (4384B_0127)
what it's worth (4384B_0129)
yeah (4384B_0131)
yeah (4384B_0139)
yeah (4384B_0141)
yeah (4384B_0143)
exactly (4384B_0144)
when you have like a or something set up and then when they get greedy or whatever that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something (4384B_0145)
that's just you know (4384B_0149)
you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time (4384B_0150)
you know you never know what they're going to get into (4384B_0153)
 that's horrible (4384B_0160)
   yeah (4384B_0162)
that's it (4384B_0169)
that's a hard thing about it (4384B_0171)
i mean i don't i can't see myself getting married (4384B_0172)
but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work (4384B_0173)
i mean i don't think i can trust somebody with my kid either (4384B_0174)
unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well (4384B_0175)
i couldn't do it i don't think (4384B_0180)
yeah (4384B_0183)
besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock in the passed away (4384B_0186)
what do you usually where (4622A_0000)
 i see (4622A_0011)
 that's nice comfortable stuff (4622A_0015)
wow (4622A_0018)
wow (4622A_0020)
that's nice (4622A_0021)
actually right now i'm a full time college student (4622A_0023)
so my very (4622A_0024)
yeah (4622A_0026)
i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime (4622A_0027)
over the summer i've had a job internships with the newspaper (4622A_0028)
and that's in allentown pennsylvania so (4622A_0030)
jenna then address you know nicer (4622A_0031)
usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts (4622A_0032)
so then it's still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of the office (4622A_0033)
you still have to have an a professional image kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that (4622A_0034)
 really (4622A_0041)
wow (4622A_0047)
that must be a nice atmosphere (4622A_0048)
wow (4622A_0064)
interesting (4622A_0067)
it's like a mini little study (4622A_0068)
that's really interesting (4622A_0070)
right (4622A_0073)
that's interesting (4622A_0076)
that's neat (4622A_0083)
that's neat (4622A_0084)
 that's nice (4622A_0100)
that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine (4622A_0101)
because here gosh we had  (4622A_0104)
hasn't been bad this winter (4622A_0105)
it it it's only snowed maybe once or twice (4622A_0106)
they've been cold (4622A_0107)
low twenties (4622A_0108)
and then the summer gets up to the eighties nineties (4622A_0109)
so (4622A_0110)
well let's see (4622B_0001)
it turns out that  (4622B_0002)
i work at (4622B_0003)
and it's a very  low key place as far as stress goes (4622B_0004)
just where  (4622B_0006)
let's see (4622B_0007)
when i first came here i wore suits (4622B_0008)
but after a while i got  found out that that wasn't all that important (4622B_0009)
i'm an engineer (4622B_0010)
and  so i get to where just  i said  walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking which like i said kind of like  via  walking shoes (4622B_0012)
yes (4622B_0016)
open  sure to open up the neck you know no time (4622B_0017)
and  just  reasonable looking i said  sports clothes or some guys where some people even wear levis (4622B_0019)
now being from philadelphia i don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed (4622B_0022)
okay (4622B_0025)
yes (4622B_0035)
yeah (4622B_0038)
well i  i just recently applied for a different job in the company here (4622B_0039)
so i decided well i wear a suit (4622B_0040)
and it was it was very interesting (4622B_0044)
yeah like i said most of the people at at this company don't wear a suit (4622B_0045)
 most of the engineers and take people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school (4622B_0046)
well it it has been (4622B_0049)
although the new president and ceo of the company is if i'm a much more formal eastern  background (4622B_0050)
and so the result is that (4622B_0052)
so anyway i wear the suits (4622B_0053)
i went over to   one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it (4622B_0054)
and that and i i was almost converted because  the effect of that suit on the way people reacted in responded to me as opposed to (4622B_0056)
 just to kind of (4622B_0057)
yeah (4622B_0058)
they know you're there (4622B_0059)
but they don't (4622B_0060)
there's no notice it (4622B_0062)
but when i wear a suit that day  it was obvious that people didn't know whether i was at work or be or manager (4622B_0063)
so people  place it made it made much more effort to notice shoe knowledge or presents say hello and  things like that (4622B_0065)
so (4622B_0066)
yeah (4622B_0069)
and so the stress for success thing i think is  (4622B_0071)
and large i've kind of effect convinced that  by that just that one   experience and and i haven't talked to several other people that that  unless you're in an environment where they're going to make fun of   better closed that better close always pay off (4622B_0072)
doesn't mean they have to be (4622B_0077)
i'm sorry say that (4622B_0078)
they don't have to be the most  absolute best (4622B_0079)
but  you know but a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would  pay off (4622B_0081)
so i'm in the process of telling my wife got to go shopping for clothes (4622B_0082)
and  i i don't know (4622B_0085)
i know eastern (4622B_0086)
well the other thing we do here is of course it as a single i'm not quite as single climate (4622B_0087)
we have  we do have some snow in the wintertime (4622B_0088)
and it can be quite warm in the summertime (4622B_0089)
not hot like  (4622B_0091)
i lived in the mid west for a while (4622B_0092)
i know that  you know it can be freezing cold in the wintertime and hot and and  sticky in the summertime (4622B_0094)
we don't have that much (4622B_0098)
it's a it's a very mild climate (4622B_0099)
yes (4622B_0102)
it is (4622B_0103)
just in would work (4643A_0000)
what kind of (4643A_0006)
time (4643A_0008)
i guess he's young (4643A_0014)
 he'll be delighted (4643A_0019)
did you do with a jigsaw (4643A_0029)
do you have power you know (4643A_0030)
well i'm i am interested in woodworking (4643A_0037)
i don't have lots of tools (4643A_0038)
our local schools have adult education the evening (4643A_0039)
 and i use their tools and and some of their guidance (4643A_0041)
i'm an artist (4643A_0042)
and i'm very handy (4643A_0044)
and you know if i touch it i it turns into something you're usually (4643A_0045)
and  well actually i'm very (4643A_0048)
i have a masters degree (4643A_0051)
and night project had to do with acrylic painting (4643A_0052)
but i'm really interested in the crafts (4643A_0053)
i make stained glass (4643A_0055)
i've done some silver jewelry making (4643A_0056)
and i kind of (4643A_0057)
once it gets you know really pretty good at something i want to try something else (4643A_0058)
yeah (4643A_0062)
actually i get good enough to sell it or have people say  wow (4643A_0063)
you didn't buy it (4643A_0064)
you made it (4643A_0065)
and it's like well let's go (4643A_0067)
something (4643A_0068)
yeah (4643A_0072)
i'm signed up for a class in pottery making 'cause i've never tried that yet (4643A_0073)
but (4643A_0075)
well actually i have a masters of art (4643A_0077)
and it's an art education (4643A_0078)
so i'm a licensed teacher (4643A_0080)
but jobs being what they are i substitute teach (4643A_0081)
and that way you have time for my kids too (4643A_0083)
and i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part time (4643A_0084)
i don't know how long this is kind of live (4643A_0085)
and  they're cutting back (4643A_0087)
so i don't go in all that often (4643A_0088)
but i've been real interested in some of those cute country country kind of things (4643A_0089)
 i see stuff in crafts galleries for five hundred dollars (4643A_0093)
and i say  no (4643A_0094)
and and i go (4643A_0095)
make it (4643A_0096)
that's how i started jewelry making (4643A_0098)
i love to cook (4643A_0099)
and i sort of silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver and and and knife in in a fork and all kinds of stuff (4643A_0101)
and i went (4643A_0103)
and they signed up for class because then again you get you know get some of the guy (4643A_0104)
you get the tools you don't feel like buying (4643A_0105)
and i made a necklace i sort of gallery for three hundred and twenty dollars (4643A_0109)
it took me a lotta time (4643A_0110)
but it didn't (4643A_0111)
but if it cost me twenty dollars you know (4643A_0114)
and then i (4643A_0115)
yeah (4643A_0118)
then i saw a one of these country looking would watermelons (4643A_0119)
it was a solid watermelon with a wage cut out of it (4643A_0120)
 yeah (4643A_0125)
i went to (4643A_0128)
we have home depot out here (4643A_0129)
i don't know if you heard of it (4643A_0130)
and i got two six foot inch thick boards turns into water (4643A_0132)
had to cut it into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lake (4643A_0136)
cutting that was no joke (4643A_0137)
we did it on  i had a  i did it through adult that again (4643A_0141)
did it through adult that again (4643A_0145)
and the teacher was one of these negative people (4643A_0147)
 that's dangerous (4643A_0148)
kansas (4643A_0149)
kansas (4643A_0150)
going well how about this way (4643A_0151)
i want to do that (4643A_0152)
that was that's why i'm here (4643A_0153)
so we did get the cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it (4643A_0155)
well the instructions and the book i had said use a coping saw (4643A_0161)
this coping so big enough to for a fourteen inches wide watermelon and (4643A_0162)
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular (4643A_0165)
and i'm not that steady (4643A_0166)
it's not going to (4643A_0167)
so we built the cradle for it (4643A_0169)
and we got the once it was turns we got one one cut out on the table saw on the radio so (4643A_0170)
but getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think of it (4643A_0172)
so (4643A_0174)
 i'd say it's a bad in a (4643A_0176)
you know just (4643A_0177)
yeah (4643B_0001)
actually i  i guess for him (4643B_0002)
 it just seems kind of funny that this is the topic of discussion (4643B_0003)
 i do  some  woodworking myself (4643B_0004)
 in fact i'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son (4643B_0005)
it's  it's  it's  plywood  face i guess (4643B_0007)
but i've cut it out in the shape of a crazy on box (4643B_0010)
and then i painted  about eight different colors  (4643B_0011)
the it'll be the head (4643B_0012)
yes (4643B_0016)
 about five and a half years (4643B_0018)
 yeah (4643B_0020)
now i just have to finish it though (4643B_0022)
i got it got delayed for a little bit and  because of work (4643B_0023)
no  i've got a jump back in and finish the (4643B_0024)
cause i've got it all cut out (4643B_0025)
it's all  (4643B_0026)
done most of the coloring (4643B_0027)
but i've got to go  second layer with the yellow (4643B_0028)
yeah (4643B_0031)
 i did a jigsaw and and  the  regular straight saw for some of it (4643B_0032)
 so (4643B_0034)
different  to do the  the turn cut (4643B_0035)
how about yourself (4643B_0036)
 okay (4643B_0043)
that's great (4643B_0046)
what type of art do focus on (4643B_0049)
yeah (4643B_0059)
kind of jack of all trades master of none (4643B_0060)
that's great (4643B_0066)
right (4643B_0069)
want to explore newfield (4643B_0070)
yeah (4643B_0071)
 so you have an m f a in in what division (4643B_0074)
 okay (4643B_0079)
yeah (4643B_0082)
 yeah (4643B_0086)
yeah (4643B_0092)
yeah (4643B_0097)
 that's great (4643B_0100)
yeah (4643B_0106)
exactly (4643B_0108)
 yeah (4643B_0112)
and your time (4643B_0116)
then you're that much farther ahead (4643B_0117)
right (4643B_0121)
i've seen them (4643B_0122)
and then the watermelon the red with the with the seeds painted in (4643B_0123)
yeah (4643B_0124)
that's neat (4643B_0127)
yeah (4643B_0133)
we have one (4643B_0134)
 i'm i'm sure (4643B_0140)
bands  (4643B_0142)
wow (4643B_0144)
right (4643B_0154)
cradle for it (4643B_0156)
yeah (4643B_0158)
so you can steady it (4643B_0159)
and then use their hands  or back so (4643B_0160)
right (4643B_0163)
right (4643B_0164)
yeah (4643B_0168)
right (4643B_0173)
did you cut a quarter wedge in this (4643B_0175)
well i i'm envisioning  a water watermelon like a lot (4643B_0178)
and then  when i've seen of this kind before is you have the  the  (4643B_0179)
it's  (4643B_0180)
if you were looking at the end on you have a complete (4643B_0181)
peer in rochester  we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as their pollution (4771A_0000)
i think grand rapids was number one (4771A_0001)
 we really don't have too much of a problem as far as  industry  since we're pretty technologically based as far as their industry in the city here (4771A_0002)
but we do have the same problem a lot of other is up here in the northeast (4771A_0003)
and that is the effects of asked and rain coming basically from the cold plants in ohio in illinois in indiana (4771A_0004)
yeah (4771A_0015)
i've i've  was in los angeles once (4771A_0016)
and that was quite a difference as far as pollution (4771A_0017)
i mean you couldn't really see that much (4771A_0018)
every once in a while we have these aaron versions the weather in versions (4771A_0019)
and then it gets hazy around here (4771A_0023)
but they're really (4771A_0024)
we don't have a big problem with it (4771A_0025)
i think that  what most of the people here in new york state or going after right now it's (4771A_0026)
it's the  ongoing ousted rain problem (4771A_0027)
especially out in the   adirondack areas where you know the lakes are becoming a change in the acidity the lakes (4771A_0028)
we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants  or alcohol and liking clinton certain than not lasting anymore because the soil levels to just changing as assassin rain continues to fall (4771A_0029)
i know that there's been battles over the states up here (4771A_0032)
 you know governor mario going after you know the governor's of ohio in indiana and all that to fix what's going on down there (4771A_0033)
i remember when i was in florida (4771A_0034)
the only problem was is that it seemed like it (4771A_0035)
wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather (4771A_0036)
yeah (4771A_0046)
yeah (4771A_0047)
 yeah (4771A_0051)
i you know i was in boston once (4771A_0052)
and i remember seeing some of these things coming through it rush hour even with the t (4771A_0053)
 just to look like billions of cars massing (4771A_0054)
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the year to go (4771A_0056)
i mean you know that's what's in los angeles (4771A_0057)
i think that's the biggest problem (4771A_0058)
because when i was in los angeles for a time it's all you know from los angeles to san diego it's like all city (4771A_0059)
and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really (4771A_0061)
 treat planning sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution in that and help (4771A_0062)
but you know if you have nowhere to do anything (4771A_0063)
yeah (4771A_0071)
i you know florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe miami (4771A_0072)
but i i've (4771A_0073)
fort lauderdale i i don't know what the big industries are down there (4771A_0074)
but you know up here we have kodak (4771A_0075)
and that's the worst pollute or (4771A_0077)
they put   (4771A_0078)
you can smell it eats or in the air sometimes (4771A_0079)
