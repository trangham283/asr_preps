you know (sw4519A_0001)
well i have to say i really don't have a budget (sw4519A_0008)
most of my wife and i  grew up in  families are rather modest means (sw4519A_0009)
and  our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say (sw4519A_0010)
and  we're both so  frugal that  i really don't need a budget (sw4519A_0011)
just sort of invest the money and go on vacation and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess it's a comfortable thing (sw4519A_0012)
 we stay within our means (sw4519A_0016)
but we don't do it  by conscious effort (sw4519A_0017)
just sort of happens automatically (sw4519A_0018)
although we just moved to california and  the cost of living here in california is  i would say rather pathological (sw4519A_0020)
 housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than   they were where i came from in  dallas (sw4519A_0022)
yeah (sw4519A_0024)
so   that presents  a real shock (sw4519A_0025)
act actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since i moved to california (sw4519A_0028)
yeah (sw4519A_0029)
 and one way you know that is that  my god can afford it (sw4519A_0035)
 so budget is not a problem for us (sw4519A_0036)
at least there hasn't been (sw4519A_0037)
may maybe at this point (sw4519A_0038)
 up until this point it really has (sw4519A_0039)
i  was in  undergraduate school on long long time ago i noticed that the monthly salary starting average monthly sally sally engineers that are in my discipline was like  six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that (sw4519A_0040)
and  i know that at that point i was you know if that's what my salary was that i do then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever (sw4519A_0042)
so i stopped worrying about money (sw4519A_0043)
and (sw4519A_0045)
have worried about money since then (sw4519A_0046)
sometimes  it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money that way i should (sw4519A_0048)
 i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of  investments (sw4519A_0049)
but (sw4519A_0050)
well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then (sw4519A_0057)
how big is your family (sw4519A_0059)
i see (sw4519A_0061)
so how (sw4519A_0064)
when once you get ten children though you may have (sw4519A_0065)
 wow (sw4519A_0068)
i have two kittens (sw4519A_0070)
 one nine and one thirteen (sw4519A_0071)
they are beginning to be a budget problem but  have not been really up until this point (sw4519A_0073)
give them  i give them an allowance (sw4519A_0076)
they  (sw4519A_0077)
i basically get my son's ten dollars a week (sw4519A_0078)
i put half of it in the bank (sw4519A_0079)
give give them the other half of the calls gas (sw4519A_0080)
and  he has  tell her card so he can  do anywhere do any wishes with the money that i put on the night (sw4519A_0082)
but at least it isn't you know bringing on his pocket (sw4519A_0083)
if he wants to use it he has to go get it (sw4519A_0085)
and that usually (sw4519A_0086)
 i i start (sw4519B_0002)
okay (sw4519B_0003)
well  we keep a budget to an extent (sw4519B_0004)
 and really we really were forced into keeping a budget because i'm i'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some   restrictions (sw4519B_0005)
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid (sw4519B_0006)
 how about yourself (sw4519B_0007)
yeah (sw4519B_0013)
well i guess that really  sort of of keeping a budget (sw4519B_0014)
stay within your within your main (sw4519B_0015)
yeah (sw4519B_0019)
yes (sw4519B_0021)
 you moved from dallas to san francisco (sw4519B_0023)
that is a huge difference (sw4519B_0026)
yeah (sw4519B_0027)
you have good sour dough (sw4519B_0030)
it's a beautiful place to live (sw4519B_0031)
yeah  and one is god can afford it  so there's not a problem and i was in  undergraduate noted that the monthly average monthly in like six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that  (sw4519B_0033)
yeah (sw4519B_0044)
that's that's a system too (sw4519B_0047)
then again you know you said you you are able to take trips (sw4519B_0051)
you do obviously have enough to live on (sw4519B_0052)
so i guess you're indirectly budgeting  just by by the fact you said that you're both very frugal  in spending the money (sw4519B_0053)
so i mean that's that's a form of budgeting i would think (sw4519B_0055)
kind of a kind of a strange topic to to try it for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money (sw4519B_0056)
yeah (sw4519B_0058)
well we're we have one on the way (sw4519B_0060)
my wife (sw4519B_0062)
and then we were having one in the way in  in  september (sw4519B_0063)
i think it's just going to be one (sw4519B_0067)
how 'bout yourself (sw4519B_0069)
do they budgeted (sw4519B_0074)
do you have them on them allowing (sw4519B_0075)
yeah (sw4519B_0081)
yeah (sw4519B_0084)
actually yeah (sw4548A_0001)
i i don't think i'm in the   majority in in texas (sw4548A_0002)
i don't think i agree with (sw4548A_0003)
 i wouldn't say that (sw4548A_0007)
think i would have said that a few years ago (sw4548A_0008)
i was younger i thought it was  a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have  capital punishment (sw4548A_0009)
but   maybe slowly changing my opinion (sw4548A_0010)
i'm not thoroughly opposed to (sw4548A_0012)
i still think it's sort of true the  more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment (sw4548A_0013)
but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought (sw4548A_0014)
yeah (sw4548A_0025)
i certainly don't advocate turning people like that loose (sw4548A_0032)
i'm not sure executing and  does any more than keeping them in jail (sw4548A_0034)
but  (sw4548A_0035)
yeah (sw4548A_0039)
that's a factor (sw4548A_0040)
yeah (sw4548A_0054)
yeah (sw4548A_0056)
yeah (sw4548A_0057)
well i (sw4548A_0058)
the cost is something (sw4548A_0059)
but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime (sw4548A_0060)
and i guess  i would like (sw4548A_0061)
i don't know (sw4548A_0062)
the european countries certainly  none of them have capital punishment (sw4548A_0063)
and they don't have they don't have a crime problem either (sw4548A_0064)
you can't (sw4548A_0067)
they don't x get anybody in britain or france (sw4548A_0068)
and i don't believe they do in germany or it'll either (sw4548A_0069)
and they don't have the crime problems we do (sw4548A_0070)
i don't really think that there's so much of a relationship between the two (sw4548A_0071)
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is  when i see people enthusiastic about it and   sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing (sw4548A_0073)
and  that that bothers me (sw4548A_0074)
but (sw4548A_0076)
but  (sw4548A_0077)
actually i what (sw4548A_0088)
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it  i don't really think it's a  very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order anything else (sw4548A_0089)
i think it just becomes a  symbolic  tougher than you are type   emotional issue for politicians (sw4548A_0090)
yeah (sw4548A_0091)
i would like it to be settled once for all and  get in the background while they're more important issues get disgusting (sw4548A_0093)
some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment and the civilized western country (sw4548A_0095)
now and i'm not so sure that (sw4548A_0097)
i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because he was four capital punishment and nor nor the other way around (sw4548A_0098)
 i guess some  (sw4548A_0100)
my view of  (sw4548A_0101)
i i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitated bowl and  that   cost and other factors justify a  executing people (sw4548A_0103)
maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that   than anything else (sw4548A_0105)
and  i've also i've never been a victim all the license and i have two friends is wise with murder (sw4548A_0106)
and  i can imagine that   for some people would be the only form of justice in that case (sw4548A_0107)
 really (sw4548B_0004)
you don't believe in it (sw4548B_0006)
yeah (sw4548B_0011)
you sound a lot like a friend of mine  a girl i hang out with (sw4548B_0015)
she has very very black and white opinions you know (sw4548B_0017)
there's no grey and her opinions (sw4548B_0018)
she she probably would agree more with you (sw4548B_0019)
but but i don't know (sw4548B_0020)
i think i would rather person go ahead and be put down and give them the opportunity to get out and do it again (sw4548B_0021)
i've never had a  punishment  crime like murder touch my immediate family (sw4548B_0022)
but i still feel very strongly capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done (sw4548B_0024)
and we see that more and more (sw4548B_0026)
in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then kill the seven year old girl (sw4548B_0027)
yeah fourteen years old (sw4548B_0029)
what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult (sw4548B_0030)
yeah (sw4548B_0033)
yeah (sw4548B_0036)
doesn't (sw4548B_0037)
but it costs less (sw4548B_0038)
and yeah (sw4548B_0041)
to me it is (sw4548B_0042)
i mean i work (sw4548B_0043)
i pay my taxes (sw4548B_0044)
and i lived out in texas for a little while (sw4548B_0045)
yeah (sw4548B_0046)
that's a pretty heavy steak compared to georgia (sw4548B_0047)
you guys are are a lot more  for to each his own even than we are in georgia (sw4548B_0048)
even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part (sw4548B_0050)
i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues (sw4548B_0051)
and we'd get along just fine (sw4548B_0052)
when i've gotta work to pay my dues and you're doing then i don't like you very much any more (sw4548B_0055)
really (sw4548B_0065)
yeah (sw4548B_0072)
might be right (sw4548B_0075)
i mean i'd i'd hate to be the person to pull the sweat you know (sw4548B_0078)
i would never in a million years want that job (sw4548B_0079)
but i do believe it's necessary (sw4548B_0081)
on one hand i i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing (sw4548B_0084)
and i couldn't pull a switch (sw4548B_0086)
but i (sw4548B_0087)
yeah (sw4548B_0092)
right (sw4548B_0094)
what's what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishment (sw4548B_0099)
yeah (sw4548B_0104)
 gosh (sw4548B_0108)
 yeah (sw4548B_0109)
ever touched my (sw4548B_0110)
i (sw4565A_0001)
actually in this modern day and age it seems like   we have more and more leisure time because  we have so many  convenience appliances and whatnot (sw4565A_0002)
they don't even have to cook dinner anymore (sw4565A_0003)
 but i  i've heard i don't know this for a fact but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together (sw4565A_0007)
and the kids maybe on the average get  something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents (sw4565A_0008)
seems bizarre to me (sw4565A_0011)
i don't quite understand that although i think probably the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television (sw4565A_0012)
so much because  it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming (sw4565A_0014)
and i think there's also some  i think  poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussion at times (sw4565A_0015)
so darned easy to turn the thing on (sw4565A_0017)
so i refuse to have one in the house (sw4565A_0020)
yeah (sw4565A_0022)
i'll tell you (sw4565A_0031)
television sure makes child rearing easy on you (sw4565A_0032)
i mean the kids can be a real past  (sw4565A_0033)
and turning the t v on and almost like magic (sw4565A_0034)
like sticking  electro it into their pleasure (sw4565A_0035)
and you don't have to worry about  (sw4565A_0036)
but i don't think it's too good (sw4565A_0039)
 so you know i don't know (sw4565A_0041)
take advantage (sw4565A_0042)
i don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids (sw4565A_0043)
but i take advantage of  dinnertime (sw4565A_0044)
we always eat together (sw4565A_0045)
and you know whenever you with your kids you want to interact with them just ignore them (sw4565A_0046)
 i guess our big outlet as music (sw4565A_0049)
or a thirteen year old son plays violin (sw4565A_0052)
and a nine year old daughter plays channel (sw4565A_0053)
and  when our son started playing violent i took up (sw4565A_0055)
when our daughter until i took up (sw4565A_0056)
so there's plenty of plenty of interactive time in a practicing although neither kid likes to practice (sw4565A_0057)
i guess that's not a big surprise (sw4565A_0058)
but i mean i imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them (sw4565A_0061)
 you know reading is so good (sw4565A_0066)
i  i took great pleasure and reading to my kids when they were little (sw4565A_0067)
and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that any more (sw4565A_0068)
 but i (sw4565A_0071)
there's this dr seuss sleep (sw4565A_0072)
have you ever seen that yeah (sw4565A_0073)
it's called asleep book (sw4565A_0077)
and  you ought to get it (sw4565A_0078)
i tell ya i read that book to my kids so many times i almost think memorized (sw4565A_0079)
yeah (sw4565A_0082)
yeah i think is sleep bucket was my favorite (sw4565A_0083)
so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average for each day (sw4565A_0098)
that's great  i see (sw4565A_0105)
so how old are your kids (sw4565A_0106)
and one (sw4565A_0107)
yeah (sw4565A_0110)
so you have your hands full (sw4565A_0111)
that's for sure (sw4565A_0112)
yeah (sw4565B_0005)
really (sw4565B_0006)
that's what i've heard too (sw4565B_0009)
yeah (sw4565B_0013)
right (sw4565B_0016)
i know (sw4565B_0018)
i find myself sometimes to sit down after work (sw4565B_0019)
 really (sw4565B_0021)
well good for you (sw4565B_0023)
good for you (sw4565B_0024)
a lot of people i've talked to a lot of people about that (sw4565B_0025)
not thought about it myself (sw4565B_0026)
and i thought about it a lot (sw4565B_0027)
but  i still haven't done any yet (sw4565B_0029)
well that's good (sw4565B_0030)
that's true (sw4565B_0037)
and  (sw4565B_0038)
i don't think so either (sw4565B_0040)
do you keep your kids  active in sports or anything (sw4565B_0047)
yeah (sw4565B_0048)
 okay (sw4565B_0051)
okay (sw4565B_0054)
no (sw4565B_0059)
for kids (sw4565B_0060)
yeah (sw4565B_0062)
well i i i try and read too (sw4565B_0063)
and i take 'em to park and stuff (sw4565B_0064)
and you know reading so good yeah (sw4565B_0065)
yeah (sw4565B_0069)
good times too (sw4565B_0070)
sleep (sw4565B_0074)
no (sw4565B_0075)
we've got a quite a few of but (sw4565B_0081)
yeah (sw4565B_0084)
yeah (sw4565B_0086)
i liked it i like to do it (sw4565B_0087)
 they enjoy reading (sw4565B_0088)
i've actually i never read a lot growing up (sw4565B_0089)
and i never read until a few years ago (sw4565B_0090)
just start picking out books (sw4565B_0091)
so i've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read (sw4565B_0092)
i like to get away in a book (sw4565B_0093)
and so i put a lot more emphasis on that  my kids (sw4565B_0096)
 i probably spend an hour or two (sw4565B_0099)
my wife works at night (sw4565B_0101)
so she does  tupperware (sw4565B_0102)
so she's gotten a lot at night (sw4565B_0103)
so i spend a lot of time with them (sw4565B_0104)
two and one (sw4565B_0108)
yeah (sw4565B_0113)
so  what things do you consider an invasion of privacy (sw4572A_0001)
i don't know (sw4572A_0004)
or trying to think about (sw4572A_0005)
i was thinking of like  (sw4572A_0006)
yeah (sw4572A_0007)
just certain think about all the big you know databases they have with all the information about you on on like the credit reports and and all those you know demographics studies that they do that  you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases you've made and everything kept track somewhere (sw4572A_0008)
i don't know (sw4572A_0011)
i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there (sw4572A_0012)
but i know they use it i mean they they sell those (sw4572A_0013)
yeah (sw4572A_0016)
that was that was the other one i was thinking that (sw4572A_0017)
i think that's  (sw4572A_0018)
i mean i know drugs are illegal (sw4572A_0019)
uh-huh uh-huh (sw4572A_0022)
uh-huh (sw4572A_0029)
well i think the  i think that you know a person's competent should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior (sw4572A_0037)
you know if they're on some kind of you know control controlled substance then you know it kinda takes away from the job of you know a supervisor or manager type person you know who is able to evaluate (sw4572A_0038)
i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with  you know a chemical you know (sw4572A_0039)
the people that are carriers and don't don't reveal (sw4572A_0041)
that'd be kind of (sw4572A_0045)
i mean i've heard of things like you know making them you know a marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all someplace like in  (sw4572A_0047)
i guess that kinda borders and where i mean what do you value more the invasion of  a person's privacy or the possible danger too you know other people (sw4572A_0050)
yeah (sw4572A_0053)
i guess that's all that's been a big role of government i guess i mean generally (sw4572A_0054)
yeah (sw4572A_0057)
well yeah that's kind of a difficult one to go into (sw4572A_0058)
i mean that that particular case (sw4572A_0059)
because i mean there's a lot of people that  (sw4572A_0062)
i mean they can require you know obligatory aids testing for everyone because i'm you know there's a huge part of the population (sw4572A_0063)
a huge part but (sw4572A_0064)
the aids population i guess that habit that don't know they do are spreading it (sw4572A_0066)
but again to require you know such a test and this and then to make make it known that they have it is to subject themselves to discriminate discriminatory practices and other things (sw4572A_0068)
i don't know (sw4572A_0069)
i don't know how exactly i feel about that (sw4572A_0070)
well i don't know (sw4572B_0002)
yeah (sw4572B_0003)
well what about  required drug testing  as a a condition of employment (sw4572B_0015)
some little thing actually (sw4572B_0020)
 i  have worked the packs of sympathy for months (sw4572B_0021)
and  they instead of the drug policy their drug testing policy where they randomly test  employees (sw4572B_0023)
and actually to tell you the truth i really didn't think much about it (sw4572B_0025)
but i hadn't (sw4572B_0026)
really didn't relate to me (sw4572B_0027)
but there were some things that people thought up like well what happens if they get a false positive you know because you have (sw4572B_0028)
and also   this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing with the big brother activity (sw4572B_0030)
and yet a lot of these large corporations such as texas probably don't admit it's actually the drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure (sw4572B_0031)
so what that means is to me that really is the government this requiring (sw4572B_0033)
no they don't actually executed themselves it's really that definitely (sw4572B_0034)
in that sense at least  philosophically it's really borderline legal (sw4572B_0035)
what about this  aids epidemic now where you find that   you know certain people actually   criminal in their disregard for others (sw4572B_0040)
yeah (sw4572B_0042)
and  of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that that  (sw4572B_0043)
 the story is there a little bit (sw4572B_0044)
now  you know if they (sw4572B_0046)
so what about that is an invasion of privacy (sw4572B_0048)
so really (sw4572B_0051)
it gets to a balancing  personal freedom against  the general welfare society (sw4572B_0052)
well most of them (sw4572B_0055)
growing apart (sw4572B_0065)
that when he was off (sw4572B_0071)
 well you know  i think public services are worthy thing (sw4603A_0003)
as a matter of fact her a lot of programs  such as peace corps that promote that (sw4603A_0004)
probably the most popular ones but  one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts (sw4603A_0006)
 i know that because my son has  scott now and  i was thinking about his ego (sw4603A_0008)
and  in order to get eagle you have to have merit badge is in  citizenship and the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world (sw4603A_0009)
and you'd have to do a public service project  in which leadership is a key element (sw4603A_0011)
i  i think the question is pose somewhat strangely because  it's talking about a requirement for public service (sw4603A_0013)
of course pay the peace corps the boy scouts as a as a voluntary activity (sw4603A_0015)
right (sw4603A_0020)
of course  a military service falls under the category  of a public service (sw4603A_0021)
and so  one of the things that wouldn't fulfill the at least a nominal  qualification set forth charge is military service our draft (sw4603A_0024)
but i agree with (sw4603A_0029)
that probably is not what was comprehend (sw4603A_0030)
there are other things such a civil service  which many people  are lifelong employees (sw4603A_0031)
but i suspect that that's not what they had in mind either (sw4603A_0035)
more of a voluntary kind of thing (sw4603A_0036)
why (sw4603A_0056)
why is that (sw4603A_0058)
 no (sw4603A_0063)
yeah (sw4603A_0065)
to defend the nation against external evils (sw4603A_0066)
 it depends on whether you whether we figured that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression or even in the military (sw4603A_0070)
okay (sw4603B_0001)
go ahead (sw4603B_0002)
right (sw4603B_0010)
right (sw4603B_0016)
i think that might be talking referring to  something that kind of a alternative to the draft (sw4603B_0018)
either you have  military service or some sort of alternative non military service for a few years (sw4603B_0019)
right (sw4603B_0022)
yeah (sw4603B_0023)
right (sw4603B_0026)
yeah (sw4603B_0032)
right (sw4603B_0034)
yeah (sw4603B_0037)
yeah (sw4603B_0041)
for for years there's been an idea bad it around having some sort of alternative  public service for  young people to go into  after high school (sw4603B_0042)
 kind of in lieu of the draft for for people who don't  who are conscientious objector or don't otherwise want to be in the military you know (sw4603B_0044)
say okay well you can go into the military (sw4603B_0045)
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of sort of the community and and learn about things (sw4603B_0046)
and it's it's interesting because i'm i'm not a particular fan of the military (sw4603B_0047)
but i haven't seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disappoint you even just personal discipline about what they want to do (sw4603B_0048)
and they come out (sw4603B_0049)
they always have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline (sw4603B_0050)
and they have  you know in some cases they have a greater self esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something or submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever and these for a for a period of time i can accomplish a lot (sw4603B_0051)
it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be you know cowboys (sw4603B_0052)
they don't need to be out there and  you know constantly flaunting there you go to get things accomplished (sw4603B_0053)
and you know for some for some young man that's good (sw4603B_0054)
for me it would have been a lousy idea  because i i did have the (sw4603B_0055)
and i went to college for years and got out (sw4603B_0057)
so but  you know for some people that's good (sw4603B_0059)
 i don't particularly like the fact that it's the military (sw4603B_0060)
and the whole point of the military as to kill people essentially as an instrument or u s one  (sw4603B_0062)
well that's one (sw4603B_0067)
you know and that's that's another debate (sw4603B_0068)
but  it's  (sw4603B_0069)
right (sw4603B_0072)
wow it's it it seems pretty aggressive aggressive or (sw4603B_0074)
you look at the military action which was in the persian gulf i wasn't anywhere near the united states (sw4603B_0075)
and it was  you know it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side (sw4603B_0076)
so at any rate this is getting off the topic (sw4603B_0077)
but (sw4603B_0078)
my point was that there's for people who don't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and  sense of community that they're doing is the boy scouts (sw4603B_0079)
so  how do you feel about the crime in your city (sw4608A_0001)
is it  (sw4608A_0002)
 really (sw4608A_0009)
uh-huh (sw4608A_0011)
 yeah (sw4608A_0014)
san jose california (sw4608A_0016)
you're you know the real problems are the gangs (sw4608A_0019)
a lot of gang related a lotta murders (sw4608A_0021)
 just in general the whole (sw4608A_0022)
we've only been here a couple of years (sw4608A_0023)
 before that we live in colorado (sw4608A_0024)
but in comparison to colorado it's real noticeable (sw4608A_0025)
i mean you can just feel i mean i can just since (sw4608A_0028)
i mean i won't even i won't go to the grocery store at night (sw4608A_0029)
you know (sw4608A_0033)
it's it's that kind of thing (sw4608A_0034)
and  (sw4608A_0035)
yea (sw4608A_0037)
we have a neighborhood watch program in the house and the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce  home fast burglary and things of that sort (sw4608A_0038)
do you have that where you live (sw4608A_0040)
 no (sw4608A_0048)
yeah (sw4608A_0057)
well you know  also i've heard that  the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home like on the weekends (sw4608A_0058)
a high percentage of  free time (sw4608A_0060)
i think it's like fifty percent and most people's free time is  spend doing yard work outdoors (sw4608A_0061)
so they wait we're out outdoors (sw4608A_0063)
they know the houses on luck (sw4608A_0064)
and then they do slip it (sw4608A_0065)
flipping flip out (sw4608A_0066)
they know exactly what they're going for (sw4608A_0068)
so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as  you know a new type of crime (sw4608A_0070)
yeah (sw4608A_0074)
unfortunately yes (sw4608A_0076)
yeah (sw4608A_0080)
uh-huh (sw4608A_0082)
i mean (sw4608A_0088)
yeah (sw4608A_0092)
helps to know your neighbors you know (sw4608A_0093)
they give you (sw4608A_0094)
you're supposed to make a list of  (sw4608A_0095)
like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my develop (sw4608A_0096)
if i see a car that unfamiliar we have a list (sw4608A_0097)
is that what you you didn't your program where you have a list of license plates (sw4608A_0098)
yeah (sw4608A_0100)
 uh-huh (sw4608A_0106)
yeah (sw4608A_0108)
i mean you you hate to be paranoid (sw4608A_0114)
but they're really only so many things you can do (sw4608A_0115)
you can have a house alarm  neighborhood watch program you know  as a woman not go out at night (sw4608A_0116)
 you can do that which is what i choose to do (sw4608A_0119)
yeah (sw4608A_0122)
but it's not (sw4608A_0132)
if you kill someone in your home as long as they're in your home it's considered self defense so (sw4608A_0133)
it isn't (sw4608A_0135)
really (sw4608A_0147)
yeah (sw4608A_0150)
yeah (sw4608A_0152)
well i think if if you had a had a hand gun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a hand gun it's middle of the night someone's down (sw4608A_0153)
well  minneapolis in too bad (sw4608B_0003)
 i know that there's been some increases and crime lately in terms of murder (sw4608B_0004)
 that's kinda gone up and scale and and similar things (sw4608B_0006)
 i personally handle experience the other day (sw4608B_0007)
somebody broke my pass through window and stole a uniform out of my truck (sw4608B_0008)
actually you know when you look at at minneapolis as compared to where i used to live it's really quite a bit better  'cause i came from florida (sw4608B_0010)
and in orlando there's crime is going to be a bigger problem than ever (sw4608B_0012)
part of california (sw4608B_0015)
 really (sw4608B_0017)
yeah (sw4608B_0020)
 yeah (sw4608B_0026)
yeah (sw4608B_0030)
yeah (sw4608B_0031)
that's really a shame when it has to constrained your activities (sw4608B_0036)
sure (sw4608B_0039)
well  interestingly enough right before i moved up here (sw4608B_0042)
i'm an intern (sw4608B_0043)
and then i go back down in may (sw4608B_0044)
 but in orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it (sw4608B_0046)
we'd been broken into in my apartment about four times two and a half weeks (sw4608B_0047)
and one of the things that i i helped organize wasn't neighborhood watch type situation down there (sw4608B_0049)
 because they were just (sw4608B_0051)
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the day like everybody went to work you know (sw4608B_0052)
and the houses were left on guard at (sw4608B_0054)
 but yeah (sw4608B_0055)
i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to work at (sw4608B_0056)
 is that right (sw4608B_0059)
that's amazing (sw4608B_0067)
yeah (sw4608B_0069)
yeah (sw4608B_0072)
almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter (sw4608B_0073)
really (sw4608B_0075)
yeah (sw4608B_0077)
fortunately starting to really you know look at people's habits are they are a particular points today (sw4608B_0078)
one of the guys i work with really laugh when he looked at minneapolis 'cause he's from detroit (sw4608B_0081)
and  the the crime level there of course it's quite a bit quite a bit  more pronounced (sw4608B_0083)
but  yeah (sw4608B_0086)
i guess (sw4608B_0087)
i think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in minneapolis (sw4608B_0089)
not real sure (sw4608B_0090)
pretty much (sw4608B_0099)
i was i was basically involved in the in the organization of it (sw4608B_0102)
and then i left right in the middle of it (sw4608B_0104)
sure where it went from there (sw4608B_0105)
but (sw4608B_0107)
that that whole thing of being alert and kinda noticing your surroundings and notice and people who look suspicious  activities like that (sw4608B_0111)
sure (sw4608B_0112)
yeah (sw4608B_0117)
yeah (sw4608B_0118)
yeah (sw4608B_0120)
one of the frustrating thing is about that is that you really are limited (sw4608B_0121)
even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps (sw4608B_0123)
it's against the law to do a lot of things (sw4608B_0125)
they could basically  (sw4608B_0126)
when i was getting rob down in florida i was really considering electra find doors  things like that like (sw4608B_0127)
in miami that time (sw4608B_0131)
that's not always true (sw4608B_0134)
no (sw4608B_0136)
there was a there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed (sw4608B_0137)
and  centrally what you've done is set up like  electric trap for the burglar in his own home (sw4608B_0139)
the guy came in while he was home (sw4608B_0142)
and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned (sw4608B_0143)
he didn't die (sw4608B_0144)
it was severely burned (sw4608B_0145)
he took the guy to court and want a settlement (sw4608B_0146)
yeah (sw4608B_0148)
so that really that makes you think (sw4608B_0149)
like your hands are very much time (sw4608B_0151)
 i i should say something (sw4611A_0003)
i'm the  least inform (sw4611A_0005)
it's totally accidental that i have to talk about this topic (sw4611A_0006)
but it's on the least in foreign person in the whole united states (sw4611A_0007)
this is not been determined yet (sw4611A_0008)
but i i i've never read the newspaper in my entire life (sw4611A_0009)
and i've i never watch t v news nerve listen to the news on the radio unless i just happened to be listening music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off (sw4611A_0010)
well (sw4611A_0013)
explore that with lots of people (sw4611A_0014)
 they've tried to lock me up and  things like that (sw4611A_0015)
but   i'm basically not interested (sw4611A_0016)
and i also find the  everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and miss in off the   (sw4611A_0017)
what am i trying to say  (sw4611A_0018)
i do learn about things largely from friends (sw4611A_0019)
and occasionally will read somebody like in the new york review of books (sw4611A_0022)
you know someone write a book about something (sw4611A_0023)
and then i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier (sw4611A_0024)
but it's (sw4611A_0026)
somehow (sw4611A_0027)
anything i participated in a no about when i read about in the paper is always so  coverage from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it (sw4611A_0028)
but i mean i don't think it's just that i'm lazy (sw4611A_0029)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0032)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0033)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0034)
right (sw4611A_0039)
yeah (sw4611A_0040)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0043)
yeah (sw4611A_0044)
yeah (sw4611A_0046)
yeah (sw4611A_0047)
just for the record (sw4611A_0048)
i'm i totally can see that intelligent people read these things intelligent people write them (sw4611A_0049)
so i mean i'm not being elitist in that sense i hope (sw4611A_0050)
yeah (sw4611A_0052)
yeah (sw4611A_0056)
by the way when you say most people think it is i think it's like ninety nine point nine ninety nine think it is (sw4611A_0057)
you don't (sw4611A_0059)
right (sw4611A_0061)
yeah (sw4611A_0063)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0068)
yeah (sw4611A_0071)
 i did on the  the supreme court hearing  for   the whole business of (sw4611A_0072)
i i actually have  (sw4611A_0073)
thomas than they need a hill business (sw4611A_0076)
i mean that's that's the closest thing (sw4611A_0078)
deeply cared about that (sw4611A_0079)
 and i sort of had plans to have dinner with a friend of mine (sw4611A_0081)
and when i ride that her how she was in gross (sw4611A_0082)
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then let me back and eat and watching it some more (sw4611A_0083)
and i thought that was perfect because she actually helped me understand what was going on (sw4611A_0084)
but even then i didn't end up doing it on my own  (sw4611A_0085)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0088)
yeah (sw4611A_0092)
yeah (sw4611A_0093)
uh-huh (sw4611A_0094)
yeah (sw4611A_0095)
do you ever read (sw4611A_0096)
any particular reason (sw4611B_0012)
really (sw4611B_0030)
and i i'd like to refer to this is sort of consumer reports phenomenon which is everybody that i know reeds consumer reports are the people who do feel that consumer reports does a holy inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assumes that they do a reasonable job in other areas  without thinking that there are people who think each other areas areas of of specialty (sw4611B_0031)
and  i guess you could explain it two ways (sw4611B_0035)
and and the cynical view as all these things aren't doing a very good job at all (sw4611B_0036)
and the view that i'd rather take is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in that topic or  particularly interested in buying something as  you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to make things (sw4611B_0037)
and i think the same thing is true with news (sw4611B_0041)
if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and and especially the better papers that the times the wall street journal the washington post give you a reasonable idea (sw4611B_0042)
if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and stuff that you once they're not printing because the average person doesn't even want to know that much (sw4611B_0045)
i mean there's there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things (sw4611B_0051)
and most people think it is (sw4611B_0054)
and i can i can you know except that some people think if not you can find better ways to use it (sw4611B_0055)
i don't think it's that high (sw4611B_0058)
i know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read the newspaper (sw4611B_0060)
and i think they're saying well if something's really important i'll at least find out that had happened (sw4611B_0062)
and and that's a that's a reasonable starts (sw4611B_0064)
for a while i didn't read the newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i like (sw4611B_0065)
 and if something important happened it was covered on t v (sw4611B_0066)
i could then go and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about (sw4611B_0067)
and i imagine you get the same level of (sw4611B_0069)
some things that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channel (sw4611B_0070)
clients thomas (sw4611B_0074)
right (sw4611B_0077)
yeah (sw4611B_0086)
i stay as far away from those just like (sw4611B_0087)
decided i didn't want to waste the time (sw4611B_0089)
i had i guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with the oliver north hearings and afterwards decided that what i'd gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time i put in these things are just very slow ways of seeing information (sw4611B_0090)
i see (sw4617A_0005)
a good a good southern solution (sw4617A_0006)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0011)
you have to say that (sw4617A_0012)
 i don't know (sw4617A_0013)
the the things they asked us to talk about or whether the whether the judge should be the one that does the sentencing (sw4617A_0014)
and it seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now (sw4617A_0016)
at least my understanding of the law which isn't very good (sw4617A_0017)
 it seems to me that the judge does it (sw4617A_0019)
i think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing (sw4617A_0020)
right (sw4617A_0023)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0026)
that's right (sw4617A_0030)
and i think that that may that may be an exception as well (sw4617A_0032)
cause i think that (sw4617A_0033)
doesn't the jury decided on the death penalty rather than than the judge (sw4617A_0034)
yeah (sw4617A_0036)
yeah (sw4617A_0039)
in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month (sw4617A_0040)
and  there's a big uproar going on right now (sw4617A_0043)
the  governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's kinda commuted or not (sw4617A_0046)
it was someone who would  killed two teenage boys here in san diego as a matter of fact (sw4617A_0048)
yeah (sw4617A_0053)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0056)
something inexpensive (sw4617A_0060)
yeah (sw4617A_0069)
i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years (sw4617A_0070)
but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake (sw4617A_0074)
you'd hate to be one of those (sw4617A_0075)
the other thing they asked about was whether   the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all the all verdicts (sw4617A_0079)
well maybe not (sw4617A_0081)
i don't know (sw4617A_0082)
at least in capital cases i think that has to be unanimous (sw4617A_0083)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0086)
the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial and that there's one that is is so different than the other eleven (sw4617A_0091)
and  they've only deliberate it for hours or something (sw4617A_0094)
and they say they're hopelessly dead lock (sw4617A_0095)
judge told them they weren't hopelessly dead locked yet (sw4617A_0097)
yeah (sw4617A_0101)
six months so far they said (sw4617A_0102)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0105)
maybe they could go with with a nine hundred number and have people dialing and give their  vote (sw4617A_0110)
right (sw4617A_0114)
 really (sw4617A_0117)
that's interesting (sw4617A_0121)
so have you ever served on a jury (sw4617A_0125)
uh-huh (sw4617A_0131)
i got called (sw4617A_0132)
but i  never  got selected for jury (sw4617A_0133)
i sat for ten days in a courtroom while they went through the selection process (sw4617A_0135)
and they had some guy that was  defending himself (sw4617A_0137)
say they  (sw4617B_0002)
probably the best thing to do is is time one of the road and throw 'em in the water (sw4617B_0003)
snake they're innocent right (sw4617B_0004)
yeah (sw4617B_0007)
yeah so  how do you how do you feel (sw4617B_0008)
that's  of course being facetious (sw4617B_0009)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0018)
yeah (sw4617B_0021)
i guess also with the system will absorb (sw4617B_0022)
probably more tuned into that (sw4617B_0024)
possibly though on  capital cases like maybe the death penalty (sw4617B_0025)
 i'm kinda undecided on that whether the judge have the soul (sw4617B_0027)
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice (sw4617B_0028)
you know judges are people like everybody else even though there's that's supposed to be impartial (sw4617B_0029)
maybe (sw4617B_0031)
i think that's i think that's the way it is (sw4617B_0035)
 whether they they decide whether or not they   accused or whatever would get the  get the death penalty (sw4617B_0037)
they have the death phone in california (sw4617B_0038)
yeah (sw4617B_0041)
yeah (sw4617B_0045)
yeah (sw4617B_0049)
something like that i've got no problem (sw4617B_0051)
i guess the way i think about is not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of is rare bands (sw4617B_0054)
just like if you got like a dog this running wild and bite and people (sw4617B_0055)
put to sleep (sw4617B_0057)
get it out you know (sw4617B_0058)
it's not able to fit in (sw4617B_0059)
yeah (sw4617B_0061)
yeah (sw4617B_0062)
exactly (sw4617B_0063)
 i guess kind of way i think about it also is they just (sw4617B_0064)
someone who gets the death penalty their their judge guilty (sw4617B_0065)
they get the death penalty (sw4617B_0066)
they should have one year and one appeal cover all the bases at one appeal (sw4617B_0067)
if not you know don't don't let him sit there on death row for fifteen years (sw4617B_0068)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0071)
yeah (sw4617B_0072)
yeah (sw4617B_0076)
 i'm sure (sw4617B_0077)
yeah (sw4617B_0078)
i believe it is and capital (sw4617B_0084)
thinking like a lesser cases it's like ten or twelve or five or six whatever however many as i was sitting on a jury (sw4617B_0085)
i believe that's the way to (sw4617B_0087)
but i'm pretty sure you're correct in capital of cases (sw4617B_0088)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0092)
yeah (sw4617B_0093)
 no (sw4617B_0096)
on the go one way or the other (sw4617B_0098)
that's probably the expensive trial (sw4617B_0099)
yeah (sw4617B_0103)
probably (sw4617B_0104)
yeah (sw4617B_0106)
i'm not sure there's a number (sw4617B_0108)
probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know more of the all the food for  (sw4617B_0109)
yeah (sw4617B_0111)
yeah (sw4617B_0112)
it's been so long i i forgot who noriega was you know (sw4617B_0113)
and has been going on (sw4617B_0115)
my  cousin is f b i agent down in miami (sw4617B_0116)
yeah (sw4617B_0118)
so she follows that person that pretty close (sw4617B_0119)
right (sw4617B_0120)
yeah (sw4617B_0122)
she's not involved in that that case (sw4617B_0123)
she does (sw4617B_0124)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0126)
haven't (sw4617B_0127)
i never had (sw4617B_0128)
my wife has (sw4617B_0129)
i haven't (sw4617B_0130)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0134)
uh-huh (sw4617B_0136)
 no (sw4618A_0003)
i haven't (sw4618A_0004)
but in my job i'm a nurse (sw4618A_0005)
and we are allowed to be (sw4618A_0006)
i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this any time (sw4618A_0007)
 i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tests (sw4618A_0008)
they can if they choose to (sw4618A_0011)
right (sw4618A_0013)
have you have you had any experience with it at all (sw4618A_0014)
uh-huh (sw4618A_0018)
what do you think about that (sw4618A_0019)
right (sw4618A_0023)
right (sw4618A_0024)
see i know of that too (sw4618A_0025)
and i also know that things like in a histamine sudafed things like that can really throw it off (sw4618A_0026)
and you can not get a job because of it (sw4618A_0027)
and they may not tell you the reason why (sw4618A_0028)
uh-huh (sw4618A_0029)
see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way (sw4618A_0037)
because i know somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job (sw4618A_0038)
and they weren't told why (sw4618A_0039)
but a lotta people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing (sw4618A_0040)
where they would tell you (sw4618A_0041)
 this person never use any drugs (sw4618A_0042)
 you should (sw4618A_0045)
because you should be given another chance or at least able to justify it or something (sw4618A_0046)
real mixed feelings about it (sw4618A_0047)
i don't know (sw4618A_0048)
accurate (sw4618A_0051)
i don't know (sw4618A_0052)
i don't know (sw4618A_0053)
but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them (sw4618A_0054)
i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something is most things will stay in your system for a long time (sw4618A_0055)
and if you could show that (sw4618A_0057)
i interviewed for a job recently (sw4618A_0058)
and my doctor gave me prescription for (sw4618A_0060)
he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proved that your doctor ordered this for you (sw4618A_0062)
it didn't come up that i needed to do it (sw4618A_0063)
but this could happen to anybody (sw4618A_0064)
and if they would just say  this person's drug tests as positive we won't hire them yeah you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything (sw4618A_0065)
so i don't know (sw4618A_0068)
yeah (sw4618A_0070)
i'm not sure either (sw4618A_0071)
the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person is using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it (sw4618A_0073)
because they say they can spot checks (sw4618A_0074)
yeah (sw4618A_0076)
well it's sort of this (sw4618A_0078)
and this is it (sw4618A_0079)
this (sw4618A_0080)
i'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways (sw4618A_0081)
you know as a professional i wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs (sw4618A_0082)
you know so as a patient and i feel well yeah we probably should be protected (sw4618A_0084)
but on the other hand there's a lot of things i should be protected from it they don't test my patience for too (sw4618A_0085)
so you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust someplace along the way (sw4618A_0086)
you can't go round testing everybody for everything (sw4618A_0088)
so i don't know (sw4618A_0090)
and i i think it could be used to hassle somebody (sw4618A_0091)
if someone was out to get you i think that a company or boss could use that (sw4618A_0092)
you know they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess (sw4618A_0093)
i can see where it could become a problem (sw4618A_0094)
really (sw4618A_0098)
 wow (sw4618A_0099)
then maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago (sw4618A_0100)
that's the other thing (sw4618A_0103)
i mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on (sw4618A_0104)
i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever (sw4618A_0105)
yeah (sw4618A_0108)
i can't say (sw4618A_0110)
yeah (sw4618A_0111)
yeah (sw4618A_0112)
so that probably wouldn't be too good either (sw4618A_0113)
 have you ever been tested for a new job or anything (sw4618B_0002)
so it's just sort of  (sw4618B_0009)
they can if they (sw4618B_0010)
 okay (sw4618B_0012)
 not really (sw4618B_0015)
but i've always worked on a university level (sw4618B_0016)
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff (sw4618B_0017)
 i don't i don't think they're very accurate (sw4618B_0020)
cause i mean i know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test (sw4618B_0021)
and i know they changed it afterwards (sw4618B_0022)
yeah (sw4618B_0030)
i had a friend (sw4618B_0031)
it it didn't caused you any problems with their job (sw4618B_0032)
but it came back that she tested positive for using loosened a gym (sw4618B_0033)
but what it was what she had been she'd been  in the jungle (sw4618B_0034)
and it was a malaria medication (sw4618B_0035)
and she tested positive for that (sw4618B_0036)
i always (sw4618B_0043)
i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more tests (sw4618B_0044)
how do you know how wrong they are (sw4618B_0049)
are they i mean is there a margin of air (sw4618B_0050)
yeah (sw4618B_0056)
uh-huh (sw4618B_0061)
yeah (sw4618B_0066)
yeah (sw4618B_0067)
i'm not so sure there that needed (sw4618B_0069)
i mean (sw4618B_0072)
if you're using it while i had a job i can see a problem (sw4618B_0075)
but the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy (sw4618B_0077)
yeah (sw4618B_0083)
yeah (sw4618B_0087)
yeah (sw4618B_0089)
it's like it seems like now they have (sw4618B_0095)
i guess they can test your hair (sw4618B_0096)
and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago (sw4618B_0097)
so (sw4618B_0101)
i know (sw4618B_0102)
yeah (sw4618B_0106)
there's a lot of things to do as a kid that you wouldn't do it as an adult (sw4618B_0107)
but you can't say it was wrong at the time (sw4618B_0109)
that's right (sw4619A_0003)
that's right (sw4619A_0004)
what what  what do you think is important (sw4619A_0005)
if you were (sw4619A_0006)
i don't know how how old you are (sw4619A_0007)
but if you had if you had  parents say or or or grandparents or whatever it is  who are already who who who you thought my benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for (sw4619A_0008)
yeah (sw4619A_0013)
yeah (sw4619A_0016)
well my   my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in  minnesota (sw4619A_0019)
and we go there once a year (sw4619A_0021)
see we tend to see her there 'cause we're in boston (sw4619A_0022)
so we're pretty far away (sw4619A_0023)
when we lived in minnesota that we've got us here (sw4619A_0024)
and it seems  (sw4619A_0026)
the environment there i don't know too much about it (sw4619A_0027)
but it it seems nice enough (sw4619A_0028)
 it's it's hard (sw4619A_0029)
at least half of the residents i would say are not not mentally sound (sw4619A_0030)
so it's hard to tell how much of that rubbed off on those who are struggling to to retain  clarity say  (sw4619A_0031)
yeah (sw4619A_0033)
well i i don't i don't know (sw4619A_0034)
we also  my wife and i   volunteer to go to a a nursing home that said just a a mile from our house (sw4619A_0035)
 she goes more often than i (sw4619A_0036)
we used to go maybe once a month or once every two months to visit some of the patients (sw4619A_0037)
and we take we have a two year old son (sw4619A_0038)
so we sometimes we take him with (sw4619A_0039)
and  there i would say it's the same thing (sw4619A_0040)
it's a it's a nice  relatively nice environment (sw4619A_0041)
but again and  it must be depressing for the people who who are who are just essentially not able to take care of themselves and their own house but but certainly  certainly have  are have retained all of their  mental skills and so on (sw4619A_0042)
it must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see and and see all these other people who really don't know where they are (sw4619A_0043)
i think yeah (sw4619A_0045)
i think they're relatively respectful yeah and and concerned as in as much as they can be (sw4619A_0046)
i think sometimes you know i've noticed  people asking for  some of the patients asking for things  just repetitive lee and for things that are not reasonable (sw4619A_0047)
and so at some level but the the  (sw4619A_0049)
i'm sure that the that the  the staff learn what's normal for this person (sw4619A_0051)
so it looks to me like maybe they're not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know (sw4619A_0052)
yeah (sw4619A_0056)
yeah (sw4619A_0057)
i'll tell you one thing though to that i i saw that was really nice (sw4619A_0058)
we saw a husband and wife (sw4619A_0059)
to see a husband and wife in their  together (sw4619A_0060)
and they were in the same room which not all husbands and wives (sw4619A_0061)
but these two are (sw4619A_0062)
and when you walked into the room they had brought all their furniture from their house (sw4619A_0064)
and so (sw4619A_0067)
yeah (sw4619A_0068)
walked in (sw4619A_0069)
it didn't look like  you know you walk in the summer homes and there's it's completely generic (sw4619A_0070)
there is nothing maybe a picture to to belong to that person (sw4619A_0071)
and that's it (sw4619A_0072)
but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that (sw4619A_0073)
and they had all their stuff in their house (sw4619A_0074)
and it looked like  it it it must have (sw4619A_0075)
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them (sw4619A_0076)
i must also give them a sense of   security and and  and and you know  (sw4619A_0077)
yeah (sw4619A_0081)
 that's temporary (sw4619A_0089)
that that that's that's new to me (sw4619A_0091)
right (sw4619A_0095)
right (sw4619A_0096)
so we're  our discussion is about  day care of the elderly (sw4619B_0002)
 well i yeah actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety (sw4619B_0009)
and he lives by himself (sw4619B_0010)
and he's in good shape (sw4619B_0012)
 but  some friends of mine have  gone through this (sw4619B_0014)
i think i look for a home where they got a lot of attention and  where they did some things to try to keep them  mentally alive and where there was  caring and compassionate where they were carrying and compassionate people  operating (sw4619B_0015)
do you have any experience with this yourself (sw4619B_0017)
from the lack of stimulation (sw4619B_0032)
do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operated seem to have what you'd perceive up as genuine concern (sw4619B_0044)
yeah (sw4619B_0050)
yeah (sw4619B_0053)
it's possible (sw4619B_0054)
and also that there'd be there can be a fair  burn out factor  and just having to respond to people's needs for the needs are sometimes depending on the person not going to be what we would perceive of his rational needs (sw4619B_0055)
okay i'm a sense of identity (sw4619B_0066)
yeah (sw4619B_0078)
i think part of what you're saying matches what i have (sw4619B_0079)
i used to initially thing that the only people who went into such residences where people who  we're adequately deficient in their abilities  physical or mental if they couldn't take care of themselves (sw4619B_0080)
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide  a lot of social activities (sw4619B_0082)
 the one of my friends' parents who went and because she had largely lost her abilities (sw4619B_0085)
and she was in there for a while and they were away on vacation (sw4619B_0086)
 and (sw4619B_0087)
i think it i think it was sort of on the ground as they were considering whether she would live there (sw4619B_0093)
and i feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded subject for like like put her in there (sw4619B_0094)
and there there's so much (sw4619B_0097)
yeah (sw4626A_0004)
yeah (sw4626A_0005)
well i i i feel like  i am from ours (sw4626A_0006)
i'm fifty years old (sw4626A_0007)
and  i've been divorced for eighteen years (sw4626A_0008)
but i have two kids and all (sw4626A_0009)
but i  i've i've never had a budget (sw4626A_0010)
i don't  i don't do any planning (sw4626A_0011)
and i don't know (sw4626A_0012)
i don't   i don't have a long term financial (sw4626A_0013)
don't try to control my expenses (sw4626A_0014)
but i'm i'm glad you're a stranger (sw4626A_0015)
 really i'm i'm happy i well i'm curious how other people live (sw4626A_0017)
 so maybe we should start with you (sw4626A_0018)
well what do you do (sw4626A_0019)
really (sw4626A_0021)
maybe they're going to restaurants (sw4626A_0024)
wow (sw4626A_0029)
uh-huh (sw4626A_0033)
yeah (sw4626A_0035)
uh-huh (sw4626A_0037)
uh-huh (sw4626A_0039)
 the  (sw4626A_0044)
i had a part time job around   gosh fifteen years ago seventy six (sw4626A_0045)
and   this was this sort of a career shift at the time (sw4626A_0046)
and so i was going to take a half time job to do that (sw4626A_0047)
and i actually did (sw4626A_0048)
my bank account would  (sw4626A_0049)
i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the (sw4626A_0050)
but i i'd miss calculator (sw4626A_0051)
i well i didn't keep a balance (sw4626A_0052)
it's one of the problems (sw4626A_0053)
i never had to in the past (sw4626A_0054)
get plenty of money in my checking account (sw4626A_0055)
but when you're only only half the salary even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes we just (sw4626A_0056)
things we get too tight (sw4626A_0057)
 and sometimes but i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet (sw4626A_0058)
and everytime i  i spend money i mean cash mostly i would  write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning (sw4626A_0059)
but i would forget the right to things (sw4626A_0062)
i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not in keeping that kind of data (sw4626A_0063)
i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or (sw4626A_0064)
yeah (sw4626A_0066)
uh-huh (sw4626A_0068)
yeah (sw4626A_0070)
the  (sw4626A_0076)
i yeah i have to say that (sw4626A_0077)
yeah (sw4626A_0078)
at this point  i don't run out of money (sw4626A_0079)
 and it  (sw4626A_0080)
i don't (sw4626A_0081)
some day if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have (sw4626A_0082)
and i  i i think my strategy if i may it is to is to not spend money (sw4626A_0083)
i mean i don't have expensive taste (sw4626A_0084)
i don't go out (sw4626A_0085)
i buy a car (sw4626A_0086)
well the last car i got rid of i'd had (sw4626A_0087)
it was nineteen years old (sw4626A_0088)
people were embarrassed for me (sw4626A_0090)
i mean if it was a good car (sw4626A_0091)
uh-huh (sw4626A_0092)
 was great (sw4626A_0094)
my my mechanics love it 'cause it was an old so it was a sixty five (sw4626A_0095)
and it just wouldn't stop (sw4626A_0096)
hum (sw4626A_0097)
i just didn't feel the need for a new car (sw4626A_0098)
like i couldn't afford one (sw4626A_0099)
 and now i mean i i don't  (sw4626A_0101)
i tend to eat expensive food (sw4626A_0102)
i mean i don't mind by a good steak (sw4626A_0103)
for me i only do that every week or  even i mean maybe once a month (sw4626A_0104)
you buy it at tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound (sw4626A_0106)
  less than a half a pound (sw4626A_0107)
so it's six seven dollars (sw4626A_0108)
the kids you're not going to run out and do that (sw4626A_0109)
but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket (sw4626A_0111)
and so if you're extravagant and how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying me if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to (sw4626A_0112)
so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need a budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have a whole bunch held back from buying them expensive thing because i can't afford it 'cause i'm not interested in that expensive (sw4626A_0114)
how are you (sw4626B_0002)
you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget (sw4626B_0003)
that sounds kind of like me (sw4626B_0016)
about the same thing (sw4626B_0020)
yeah (sw4626B_0022)
i mean even in worse shape because i have eight children (sw4626B_0025)
and  we live from (sw4626B_0026)
we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills (sw4626B_0027)
and if there is nothing we try to do for the next month (sw4626B_0028)
a couple of times we try and things (sw4626B_0030)
and they were (sw4626B_0031)
but i'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it (sw4626B_0032)
the program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we cook and  my checking divided it out into envelopes and then paid for the expenses outta that envelope (sw4626B_0034)
when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area (sw4626B_0036)
and that worked out real well because we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spend (sw4626B_0038)
and it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money (sw4626B_0040)
and we did that pretty successfully for about three months (sw4626B_0041)
and then we started bar envelope put it in the other envelope (sw4626B_0042)
in about two months we were back to doing this and we always do (sw4626B_0043)
i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll take money out of that (sw4626B_0065)
and then i forget to take that out of my checking account (sw4626B_0067)
and  (sw4626B_0069)
so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account (sw4626B_0071)
and i figure that so the balance showing the checking account is always somewhat different than what's really there (sw4626B_0072)
and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make (sw4626B_0074)
yeah (sw4626B_0089)
it was still running (sw4626B_0093)
yeah (sw4626B_0105)
very often (sw4626B_0110)
that's right (sw4626B_0113)
what what what sort of come and do you work (sw4628A_0001)
worked for a big place or a little place (sw4628A_0002)
well i i work for  actually probably similar kind of place (sw4628A_0019)
worked for lincoln laboratory (sw4628A_0020)
 yeah (sw4628A_0022)
we actually do some work with some people down in georgia tech (sw4628A_0023)
so we're we're we're actually part of m i t (sw4628A_0027)
so it's very much the same kind of place and  technical institution (sw4628A_0028)
sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what   what things were important  besides salary in a in a job i guess  because of the list people you work with and maybe the the challenge of the work and  the working conditions things like that (sw4628A_0031)
uh-huh (sw4628A_0034)
what are your what sorts of things would you consider important (sw4628A_0035)
yeah (sw4628A_0044)
 how do you mean that (sw4628A_0063)
 it's (sw4628A_0064)
well you you think it's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company (sw4628A_0070)
yeah (sw4628A_0080)
yeah (sw4628A_0083)
i've heard of a couple of companies that have done that (sw4628A_0084)
i think  back a few years ago and things were tough hewlett packard did that for a while (sw4628A_0085)
i went to a    four and a half day work week rather than yeah just cut everybody back ten percent and a half gave everybody half a day a week off (sw4628A_0086)
i think you can do that for a little while (sw4628A_0090)
but  (sw4628A_0091)
yeah (sw4628A_0093)
 for georgia tech (sw4628B_0003)
yes (sw4628B_0004)
for their research facility (sw4628B_0005)
 yeah this is kind of small in the senate (sw4628B_0006)
but it it does have about i guess two thousand so employees (sw4628B_0007)
and on  a scale i guess it's they're considered a small (sw4628B_0009)
just have a lot of different laboratories (sw4628B_0010)
the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people so (sw4628B_0012)
so that make up most of the laboratory (sw4628B_0014)
so from from that standpoint is pretty small foreigners (sw4628B_0015)
what about yourself (sw4628B_0017)
 okay (sw4628B_0021)
 okay (sw4628B_0024)
 okay (sw4628B_0029)
right (sw4628B_0030)
right (sw4628B_0033)
well those and probably the security aspects of it (sw4628B_0036)
because a lot of this time nowadays even though you working  you're treated (sw4628B_0038)
and it may not be true in every place (sw4628B_0039)
it's a lot of cases i think he treated more like a number instead of a person (sw4628B_0040)
because when it comes down to lay off they don't really consider to people and and you know their wellbeing this you know how they go to the next dollars don't come in and how they're going to pay the bills (sw4628B_0042)
they just like a mall (sw4628B_0043)
and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had  (sw4628B_0045)
i think the company's still exist (sw4628B_0046)
what did they used to do is they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know (sw4628B_0047)
that way that you know one person one get one big blonde flow at one time (sw4628B_0049)
and  you know i think if they have programs set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better you know and so you know something (sw4628B_0051)
unemployment is good (sw4628B_0052)
but i mean the company as a whole (sw4628B_0053)
cause you as an employee (sw4628B_0054)
even though the company is making money (sw4628B_0055)
they're paying your salary (sw4628B_0056)
but you are responsible for that company girls (sw4628B_0057)
you are responsible also for helping that constantly get to the park point that is that it making profit (sw4628B_0058)
so there should be something in there are some kind of clause that will subsidized people if they did lose their job other than you know  or something like that (sw4628B_0059)
you know because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying  businesses or or not on up in up all the time you know (sw4628B_0061)
i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of situation (sw4628B_0062)
well in a sense that say how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people  for the bad times of the company (sw4628B_0065)
about the war care for those ten people today when the company was doing well (sw4628B_0067)
you know in that standpoint (sw4628B_0069)
yes (sw4628B_0072)
yeah (sw4628B_0073)
i really do (sw4628B_0075)
i think it'd be better that way (sw4628B_0076)
and even at that it will at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that you know there are problems (sw4628B_0077)
and you know there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time (sw4628B_0079)
you know that's just a small views you know (sw4628B_0082)
right (sw4628B_0087)
right (sw4628B_0088)
right (sw4628B_0089)
well at least that would give a person a chance of law you know because the way it is a partial really don't have a chance (sw4628B_0092)
i have five (sw4633A_0002)
right (sw4633A_0004)
well five or four of them are grown (sw4633A_0006)
they're in college or just out of college (sw4633A_0007)
so i really have just a thirteen year old at home (sw4633A_0008)
well i work at it (sw4633A_0011)
i try to fool everybody (sw4633A_0014)
uh-huh (sw4633A_0017)
uh-huh (sw4633A_0022)
i think you're right (sw4633A_0024)
because i was an only child too (sw4633A_0025)
and that's one reason i have so many because i really i enjoy the big family (sw4633A_0026)
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sister (sw4633A_0028)
so she's sort of like an only child (sw4633A_0029)
it's the same type of thing  (sw4633A_0030)
uh-huh (sw4633A_0035)
yeah (sw4633A_0037)
right (sw4633A_0040)
that's exactly how it is (sw4633A_0041)
she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her (sw4633A_0042)
when things don't go right she just called one of them you know (sw4633A_0043)
but  yeah (sw4633A_0045)
it's it's a little bit difficult (sw4633A_0046)
i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home or (sw4633A_0047)
we really did not (sw4633A_0050)
my next oldest daughter that's in college and california's a world twirling champion (sw4633A_0051)
and we did a lot of things together (sw4633A_0053)
she and i did a lot of things together and blue (sw4633A_0055)
flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform (sw4633A_0056)
and that was a lot of fun (sw4633A_0058)
but that that i guess you could consider that organized (sw4633A_0059)
there's a competition all the time (sw4633A_0060)
we were very heavy into that (sw4633A_0062)
other than that they were pretty much (sw4633A_0063)
maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that (sw4633A_0064)
uh-huh (sw4633A_0068)
i can't afford to (sw4633A_0070)
right (sw4633A_0074)
right (sw4633A_0081)
that's right (sw4633A_0082)
uh-huh (sw4633A_0086)
yeah (sw4633A_0087)
i know i spend hours in the gym every day with my daughter (sw4633A_0088)
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice (sw4633A_0089)
she had to go with me (sw4633A_0090)
the three of us just spend a lot of time traveling and and competing (sw4633A_0092)
of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was (sw4633A_0093)
that was making the friends and going all the places (sw4633A_0094)
and it was a really neat experience (sw4633A_0095)
but it took our total time (sw4633A_0096)
i did not work  when i did this (sw4633A_0097)
now i do work full time (sw4633A_0098)
and it's just my thirteen year old in myself (sw4633A_0100)
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities and and still have time to spend with each other (sw4633A_0101)
yeah (sw4633A_0108)
really (sw4633A_0119)
well things cost a lot more (sw4633A_0121)
i don't know how it is in georgia (sw4633A_0122)
i don't think our part of the countries particularly bad compared to some (sw4633A_0124)
is it (sw4633A_0126)
really (sw4633A_0130)
right (sw4633A_0134)
that's what i (sw4633A_0135)
i'm surprised to hear that (sw4633A_0145)
her very positive things about atlanta (sw4633A_0146)
children do you have to (sw4633B_0001)
you have five (sw4633B_0003)
 you do have a hard time finding time then (sw4633B_0005)
you sound so young (sw4633B_0010)
they have 'em  (sw4633B_0013)
 you're doing a good job (sw4633B_0015)
i just have one child (sw4633B_0016)
and  i don't think  (sw4633B_0018)
or there's not much i can do about it (sw4633B_0019)
my wife in our in our forties you know (sw4633B_0020)
so  (sw4633B_0021)
but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pay that point of the universe (sw4633B_0023)
yea (sw4633B_0027)
i have a younger brother like that (sw4633B_0032)
 in my forties (sw4633B_0033)
i have a brother in his twenties (sw4633B_0034)
and i was i was the youngest (sw4633B_0036)
so i understand how that would (sw4633B_0038)
and he was traded like he had five fathers or something (sw4633B_0039)
yeah (sw4633B_0044)
did you all do a lot of organized things like  little league  soccer (sw4633B_0049)
uh-huh (sw4633B_0054)
yeah (sw4633B_0061)
yeah i think that's probably true (sw4633B_0065)
to (sw4633B_0066)
if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events for activities (sw4633B_0067)
and if you have a large number two older than you don't (sw4633B_0069)
yeah (sw4633B_0071)
yeah (sw4633B_0072)
there's not enough time (sw4633B_0073)
my son's in  little league this year (sw4633B_0075)
ten (sw4633B_0076)
and they practice three times a week (sw4633B_0077)
and i have a game (sw4633B_0078)
it's just  (sw4633B_0079)
if they were more than one child i don't know that they would they know what it is it (sw4633B_0080)
you know one parent go one direction (sw4633B_0083)
and i'd have to go on the other (sw4633B_0084)
it will get on the cover too at that (sw4633B_0085)
i don't think although (sw4633B_0103)
i think a lot more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me (sw4633B_0104)
i'm not sure i could afford (sw4633B_0105)
i'm all certainly couldn't educate (sw4633B_0106)
i don't know how my my parents did (sw4633B_0107)
and they were five of us (sw4633B_0109)
i don't really tell you know wanting anything in particular (sw4633B_0110)
 but i don't know how my father did it's (sw4633B_0111)
he worked at a truck (sw4633B_0112)
i just didn't make that kinda money with five children (sw4633B_0113)
but we did okay (sw4633B_0114)
had a house and home (sw4633B_0115)
now my wife and i both work (sw4633B_0116)
and we don't i don't believe we'll have as much as my parents (sw4633B_0117)
and we only have one child (sw4633B_0118)
laughter is horrible (sw4633B_0125)
yeah (sw4633B_0127)
and we have a lot of people moving here from boston and in different areas (sw4633B_0128)
i'm from talking to them they're shop (sw4633B_0129)
and they (sw4633B_0132)
the housing so cheap in comparison to boston that they jump on it (sw4633B_0133)
they sell their house (sw4633B_0136)
say stashed away a good bit of money and come down here (sw4633B_0137)
i work with a lot of  (sw4633B_0138)
they think they they've really done something (sw4633B_0139)
when i get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to divorce i came from (sw4633B_0140)
housings cheaper (sw4633B_0143)
but that's about it (sw4633B_0144)
i  try to stay away from cars as much as possible and things of repair (sw4642A_0001)
actually  that is really a sore spot with me (sw4642A_0002)
i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving (sw4642A_0003)
but  like ten years ago  the reliability of automobiles lacey u s automobiles is pretty dismal (sw4642A_0004)
and not only that but the  repair capability of  service department said dealerships was equally dismal (sw4642A_0005)
and  it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of like i was three parent myself which is not my cup of tea (sw4642A_0007)
but  (sw4642A_0009)
pardon (sw4642A_0011)
well at that time actually i had a volkswagen rabbit (sw4642A_0013)
and  it was it was a real lemon (sw4642A_0015)
 subsequently i've got a  buick century (sw4642A_0016)
it wasn't as bad (sw4642A_0017)
but  last year i bought a honda accord (sw4642A_0019)
and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for it's periodic maintenance (sw4642A_0020)
and that is it (sw4642A_0021)
and it's a wonderful (sw4642A_0022)
so what do you what do you have (sw4642A_0037)
all the more reason to have a a honda (sw4642A_0039)
so you bought a (sw4642A_0045)
yeah (sw4642A_0055)
how old is the (sw4642A_0056)
so it probably was the same one that was on there (sw4642A_0081)
probably just   probably filled  the (sw4642A_0083)
and that was (sw4642A_0084)
so what's the solution to that (sw4642A_0089)
i guess find a reputable service (sw4642A_0090)
right (sw4642A_0099)
 that's wonderful (sw4642A_0103)
you're lucky (sw4642A_0105)
 really (sw4642A_0113)
yeah (sw4642B_0008)
so do you have a car (sw4642B_0010)
do you have a car (sw4642B_0012)
we used to have on  (sw4642B_0024)
they're good (sw4642B_0025)
they really get cars (sw4642B_0026)
every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken (sw4642B_0027)
bad you know (sw4642B_0028)
and goes (sw4642B_0030)
and they go all right we got a sucker (sw4642B_0031)
let's get him a sandwich money we can get out ever you know (sw4642B_0032)
that's it happens every time (sw4642B_0034)
hum (sw4642B_0036)
i have a pontiac six thousand (sw4642B_0038)
yup (sw4642B_0040)
but our honda just got old and just wore out (sw4642B_0041)
let's see eleven years old (sw4642B_0042)
and it just just out of it (sw4642B_0043)
no (sw4642B_0044)
yeah (sw4642B_0046)
 ex husbands (sw4642B_0047)
this is just happen (sw4642B_0048)
my cousin (sw4642B_0049)
this a few months ago when he was my husband  his father gave us this car (sw4642B_0050)
and everything is wrong with it (sw4642B_0051)
i mean the power steering fluid lakes (sw4642B_0052)
all (sw4642B_0053)
break fluids legs you know (sw4642B_0054)
 eighty seven (sw4642B_0057)
and he just doesn't take care of things (sw4642B_0059)
but i was awarded the car (sw4642B_0060)
so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic (sw4642B_0061)
i can trust him (sw4642B_0062)
so he's trying to get you know things fixed on it (sw4642B_0063)
but it's just you know lake lake lake everywhere (sw4642B_0065)
but  you know i hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not you know in charge me twice as much (sw4642B_0066)
the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder (sw4642B_0067)
so i said okay (sw4642B_0068)
and he charge me a hundred and thirty something dollars (sw4642B_0069)
and then  about a month later  man was looking in my car (sw4642B_0070)
and he asked me you know (sw4642B_0071)
not a man not a repairman but just a friend (sw4642B_0072)
and i was telling him that i just had him new master soldier put on (sw4642B_0073)
and he looked at (sw4642B_0074)
he said that's not a new master cylinder (sw4642B_0075)
and i didn't even know what one was (sw4642B_0077)
and  he showed it to me (sw4642B_0078)
it was old rusty just awful (sw4642B_0079)
it was no more new than nothing (sw4642B_0080)
more than likely (sw4642B_0082)
was it probably (sw4642B_0085)
it was very (sw4642B_0086)
i was so irritated (sw4642B_0087)
and that's happened to me more than once or twice just just just about every time i went in similar (sw4642B_0088)
and and you just how can hardly find one you know (sw4642B_0091)
the my my car now  goes to my church (sw4642B_0093)
and that's the only reason you know i go to him 'cause i know him (sw4642B_0094)
i know he will tell you the truth (sw4642B_0096)
because he didn't even charge me for for doing it (sw4642B_0097)
so he's not going to you know take me (sw4642B_0098)
just pay for the parts (sw4642B_0100)
and he does it (sw4642B_0101)
so (sw4642B_0102)
yeah (sw4642B_0104)
yeah (sw4642B_0106)
yeah (sw4642B_0107)
so i don't know (sw4642B_0108)
i don't know what the solution to that is (sw4642B_0109)
because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all (sw4642B_0110)
we took our honda do the hunter dealership (sw4642B_0111)
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for a car (sw4642B_0112)
yeah (sw4642B_0114)
and so any it's as we were neither one of us knew much by car (sw4642B_0115)
you know they told us we just had to have one (sw4642B_0116)
we bought one (sw4642B_0117)
we didn't know more than a new new into (sw4642B_0118)
give me a break (sw4642B_0119)
so it was it was not good (sw4642B_0121)
and  (sw4642B_0122)
you know anyone that  as is in a nursing home or it's ever been in one (sw4646A_0001)
uh-huh (sw4646A_0005)
well i'm trying to think (sw4646A_0007)
my  wife's grandmother had alzheimer's (sw4646A_0008)
and they were going to put her into a a nursing home (sw4646A_0009)
and  they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble (sw4646A_0010)
and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being   you know a nuisance or worse than a nuisance (sw4646A_0011)
she's sort of went you know bananas (sw4646A_0012)
and they couldn't couldn't deal with her (sw4646A_0014)
so i guess you need to know whether it's eighty you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether (sw4646A_0015)
yeah (sw4646A_0018)
right (sw4646A_0020)
right (sw4646A_0023)
my grandmother actually was in a nursing home that  (sw4646A_0024)
there was a retirement hotel and then they  (sw4646A_0025)
there was some sort of fulltime care place that was also associated with it (sw4646A_0026)
so for  the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else (sw4646A_0027)
and then  she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into the southern part that was able to  provide fulltime care (sw4646A_0029)
 she didn't have to do anything anymore (sw4646A_0030)
the my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly (sw4646A_0031)
and that's (sw4646A_0032)
i don't know whether that's because they you know it's sort of give up hope once they get in there or what  what the reason is (sw4646A_0033)
but i think the average length of time that somebody who lives in a nursing home it's only like six months or something (sw4646A_0034)
yeah (sw4646A_0036)
right (sw4646A_0039)
yeah (sw4646A_0041)
if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are (sw4646A_0042)
 there as a last resort (sw4646A_0043)
or people send you their as a last resort (sw4646A_0045)
uh-huh (sw4646A_0050)
right (sw4646A_0053)
right (sw4646A_0055)
yeah (sw4646A_0057)
i guess (sw4646A_0058)
right (sw4646A_0062)
when you need it you needed i guess (sw4646A_0063)
right (sw4646A_0066)
yeah (sw4646A_0069)
sure (sw4646A_0072)
and you'd probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on the lowest price (sw4646A_0074)
yeah (sw4646A_0081)
so maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home has to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing (sw4646A_0082)
yeah (sw4646A_0086)
right (sw4646A_0088)
quite a few people that have  gone to retirement communities (sw4646A_0090)
i don't know if they have them back there (sw4646A_0091)
but here in california and in there (sw4646A_0092)
no (sw4646B_0002)
but i my grandparents were looking into it before (sw4646B_0003)
so i know what they've said (sw4646B_0004)
 they thought it was too much of a bother (sw4646B_0013)
right (sw4646B_0016)
they're quick to to handle the kind of patient you're going to have you had to put in there too (sw4646B_0017)
because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still (sw4646B_0019)
they want to someplace and go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed (sw4646B_0021)
they wanted to be independent as well have their own room (sw4646B_0022)
well a lot of time to do with the fact that people go to because they need help (sw4646B_0035)
they need healthcare (sw4646B_0037)
they're already ill before they go (sw4646B_0038)
that's probably a large factor (sw4646B_0040)
right (sw4646B_0046)
right (sw4646B_0047)
my grandparents (sw4646B_0048)
it was just so that the rest of the relatives wouldn't have peace of mind knowing that if something happened there was somebody there for them (sw4646B_0049)
so that was their thinking (sw4646B_0051)
somebody who would know what you do in the event of an emergency (sw4646B_0052)
and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had choices to make they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time (sw4646B_0054)
i guess that's the problem too for people weightless (sw4646B_0056)
that  (sw4646B_0059)
you can't always get in when you want (sw4646B_0060)
and of course you can't just sit around and wait (sw4646B_0061)
yeah (sw4646B_0064)
in the money is also another issue how you're going to pay for it (sw4646B_0065)
the stage of life you only have so much money left (sw4646B_0067)
i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings (sw4646B_0068)
i mean it is kind of (sw4646B_0070)
but it's also not fair because they had their own children to raise (sw4646B_0071)
so that's another problem (sw4646B_0073)
right (sw4646B_0075)
right (sw4646B_0076)
so it's it's just so complicated anymore i think (sw4646B_0077)
people outlived their savings (sw4646B_0078)
than with medicine being the way it is you're extending lives or sometimes the quality of living has gone down (sw4646B_0079)
and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore (sw4646B_0080)
it's just a shame that is what has to be (sw4646B_0083)
i think the retirement home ideas a nice idea (sw4646B_0084)
to go and find older people and with similar interests in some place to stay (sw4646B_0085)
and like if your spouse died all the same be all alone it'd be nice to go someplace people similar to you have friends (sw4646B_0087)
i've had  three boys through i guess  some childcare each one of the (sw4649A_0001)
now they're in school (sw4649A_0002)
so it's all over (sw4649A_0003)
but  i guess i would say it's not easy to find what what most parents would (sw4649A_0004)
is that right (sw4649A_0006)
i guess  the  the only rule i can think of is that  i like to look for places with a good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that (sw4649A_0007)
they're associated with the college or university they're usually pretty good (sw4649A_0008)
 i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car a refrigerator or something (sw4649A_0010)
like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with childcare (sw4649A_0011)
yeah (sw4649A_0014)
for profit places i would really look at it awfully carefully (sw4649A_0015)
 when i was when my kids were young i was teaching at a university (sw4649A_0017)
and  the childcare centre associated with our university was quite good (sw4649A_0018)
so i felt confident that they (sw4649A_0019)
 you mean  learning type (sw4649A_0023)
i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission (sw4649A_0025)
but yeah (sw4649A_0027)
i suppose  if you're if there's a psychology department of education probably around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another (sw4649A_0028)
i guess that's true (sw4649A_0029)
 i never had a bad experience in that respect (sw4649A_0030)
question also tend to get people that are associated with the university in the hospital as the parents (sw4649A_0031)
and they you know pretty good people (sw4649A_0032)
yeah (sw4649A_0037)
never really worry much about it (sw4649A_0038)
tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public (sw4649A_0039)
so i never really worry too much about that being the case with my boys (sw4649A_0040)
 i you know i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about it (sw4649A_0043)
and (sw4649A_0044)
i don't think it's a communist  the newspapers would make you believe (sw4649A_0046)
yeah (sw4649A_0049)
i mean (sw4649A_0050)
in our case we made a decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were  in school (sw4649A_0055)
i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult (sw4649A_0056)
 i think it was the right thing to do (sw4649A_0057)
and we were  we just decided that we would (sw4649A_0059)
we went ahead (sw4649A_0060)
 not everybody can make that choice (sw4649A_0061)
and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have  one or another of the boys and  childcare for part time just for a part of the day  or a couple of days a week just to the  other things could get done around the house and and so on (sw4649A_0062)
so we did look around (sw4649A_0063)
i think my wife is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it's a loving caring place or not (sw4649A_0065)
and  so i would always trust her judgement on that (sw4649A_0066)
uh-huh (sw4649A_0072)
absolutely no question that you're going to be the best childcare provider for that (sw4649A_0078)
as long as you can (sw4649A_0080)
but i think yeah you have to look through a place (sw4649A_0082)
and they have to get a feel for  how they treat the kids and   what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child (sw4649A_0083)
i think you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome any time without notice middle of the day and so forth (sw4649A_0086)
there at all queasy about that than i'd look elsewhere (sw4649A_0087)
yeah (sw4649A_0088)
you have other friends that have kids are being taken care of in the childcare (sw4649A_0093)
so but i really think the news reports or  tend to sensationalize the problems (sw4649A_0097)
the problems are more ones of cost and resources and  pay and exhaustion and human things like that rather than these then  really wild abuse cases that you read about that make good copy (sw4649A_0099)
yeah (sw4649A_0101)
uh-huh (sw4649A_0103)
uh-huh (sw4649A_0104)
well i can profit by this because i'm doing my first in about three months (sw4649B_0005)
i guess not yours (sw4649B_0012)
i suppose you're absolutely right there (sw4649B_0013)
don't they kind of use them for everybody guinea pigs for their for their pet theories or some such thing (sw4649B_0022)
yes (sw4649B_0026)
well let's see really worry about is  the sexual abuse cases you read about (sw4649B_0034)
and i mean you just feel awful something like that happened (sw4649B_0036)
and the other thing is cost (sw4649B_0048)
i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now (sw4649B_0051)
they finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare (sw4649B_0052)
i'm just saying heaven (sw4649B_0069)
my husband just got a new job (sw4649B_0070)
his last company he was only working four days a week (sw4649B_0071)
so it's (sw4649B_0073)
and he just got a new job (sw4649B_0074)
lots of overtime (sw4649B_0075)
he got a pay raise (sw4649B_0076)
and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not (sw4649B_0077)
i suppose (sw4649B_0081)
you have to start wondering if they don't want (sw4649B_0089)
yes (sw4649B_0090)
 i have one (sw4649B_0094)
i haven't really had a chance to talk to about that for a while (sw4649B_0095)
this is true (sw4649B_0100)
current affairs and getting several shows those cases (sw4649B_0102)
you think (sw4659A_0001)
yeah (sw4659A_0003)
can be (sw4659A_0005)
go ahead (sw4659A_0006)
right (sw4659A_0017)
facts everything (sw4659A_0018)
we don't even wait for the male anymore (sw4659A_0021)
right (sw4659A_0023)
right (sw4659A_0029)
right (sw4659A_0033)
right (sw4659A_0035)
you're expected to (sw4659A_0037)
exactly (sw4659A_0038)
and i recently read an article on justice that said stress today is so much worse (sw4659A_0039)
should be less because we have a microwave (sw4659A_0040)
grandmothers had bake brownies (sw4659A_0041)
and we can throw 'em in the microwave for two minutes (sw4659A_0042)
but the more conveniences we have the moral that's expected of us (sw4659A_0043)
and we have no downtime (sw4659A_0045)
like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to (sw4659A_0046)
so we keep moving (sw4659A_0048)
we don't stop and wait for the things to bake in this to happen and that to happen (sw4659A_0049)
we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing (sw4659A_0050)
so we have no relaxation time in between (sw4659A_0051)
so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things (sw4659A_0053)
so that's good (sw4659A_0055)
that's an interesting point (sw4659A_0056)
but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically (sw4659A_0057)
i think that's just (sw4659A_0058)
course part of it is technology (sw4659A_0059)
in our kids where would they be without nintendo and you know their t v shows (sw4659A_0060)
not (sw4659A_0061)
some of that is really bad i think (sw4659A_0062)
but we have a single family (sw4659A_0063)
so many single families now (sw4659A_0064)
 a lot of working (sw4659A_0065)
both parents are working (sw4659A_0066)
there's a whole big effect on our kids (sw4659A_0067)
not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father (sw4659A_0068)
in our wondering what this is going to do and ten and twenty years (sw4659A_0069)
you're probably right (sw4659A_0073)
 i'm an o b nurse (sw4659A_0074)
i've never really occurred to me (sw4659A_0075)
that's that's interesting (sw4659A_0076)
i never really thought about it that way (sw4659A_0077)
yeah (sw4659A_0083)
yeah (sw4659A_0084)
that's true (sw4659A_0085)
is this good or not good (sw4659A_0086)
we don't know that yet (sw4659A_0088)
yeah (sw4659A_0090)
i don't know either (sw4659A_0091)
that's true (sw4659A_0092)
right (sw4659A_0095)
right (sw4659A_0096)
yeah (sw4659A_0099)
yeah (sw4659A_0100)
that's kind of scary (sw4659A_0101)
 well that's true (sw4659A_0102)
but (sw4659A_0103)
it's just very very different (sw4659A_0104)
i guess every ten years it's just been very different (sw4659A_0105)
no no i don't know what's going to happen (sw4659A_0107)
 you know what i'm see here at my my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're established in careers (sw4659A_0108)
and they've got their home (sw4659A_0111)
and they've got (sw4659A_0112)
well  i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago  'cause i'm not that old yet (sw4659B_0002)
 i know that  (sw4659B_0007)
i mean obviously you look at technological technological aspect of of social change (sw4659B_0008)
i mean you didn't have  you didn't have video games (sw4659B_0009)
you didn't have home computers (sw4659B_0010)
you didn't have this iraq's machines (sw4659B_0011)
i mean yeah you try to (sw4659B_0013)
you go into   business today (sw4659B_0014)
and and you try to imagine the whole thing except for any off of carbon paper (sw4659B_0015)
and it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines and and everything has become such you know such such a part of the way we live (sw4659B_0016)
yeah (sw4659B_0019)
yeah (sw4659B_0020)
yeah (sw4659B_0024)
 business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail (sw4659B_0025)
you had to do something (sw4659B_0026)
this was concerning the s._e._c. (sw4659B_0027)
and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail (sw4659B_0028)
and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes you know through a fax machine (sw4659B_0030)
and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have actually made work that much more intense and that much harder (sw4659B_0034)
because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute (sw4659B_0036)
yeah (sw4659B_0047)
well there's that (sw4659B_0070)
and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen (sw4659B_0071)
i mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country (sw4659B_0072)
yeah (sw4659B_0078)
so the the numbers on that a while back (sw4659B_0080)
and i was like uh-huh (sw4659B_0081)
well  in terms of the long term effect effect on on america in terms of the culture and everything i don't know (sw4659B_0087)
 most of the of the next generation is going to be you know or or extremely large part part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation  from immigrant parents (sw4659B_0089)
and they're going to be really struggling (sw4659B_0093)
and i don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good (sw4659B_0094)
i mean it's no longer the yeah the accomplishment that had been at once (sw4659B_0097)
not that many people are really trying i don't think (sw4659B_0098)
yeah (sw4659B_0106)
yeah (sw4659B_0109)
go ahead and start (sw4679A_0001)
they think if if trials were held by judges are experts that they they would tend not to admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence (sw4679A_0008)
you know i i attended a trial in  in germany when i was a student (sw4679A_0010)
and  that's the sort of system they have (sw4679A_0011)
trials are held by a panel of three  three or four judges who are (sw4679A_0013)
 they're like lawyers i guess (sw4679A_0014)
experts in the law (sw4679A_0015)
and  there really isn't the jury (sw4679A_0017)
and   they do the questioning also (sw4679A_0018)
the judges do the question (sw4679A_0019)
and  (sw4679A_0020)
it's (sw4679A_0022)
i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they   the judges also sort of a jury (sw4679A_0023)
but i'm not sure i like that (sw4679A_0024)
i think i prefer the jury (sw4679A_0025)
 well actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or the jury (sw4679A_0028)
what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual (sw4679A_0029)
that's where you really need a jury of peers (sw4679A_0030)
because  any time they the government  if the government against an individual you need some yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizen (sw4679A_0031)
i think that's really the only thing (sw4679A_0033)
i guess where i would like to see this system changes (sw4679A_0034)
  there ought to be   (sw4679A_0035)
well i guess i don't think that   juries need to decide sentencing all the time (sw4679A_0036)
i think maybe that  judges have better judge of that (sw4679A_0038)
or  (sw4679A_0039)
yeah (sw4679A_0048)
if you drank twelve people into a court room i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent (sw4679A_0049)
that's usually a matter of who to believe in what facts to believe (sw4679A_0050)
people who who don't have day in and day out lifelong experience with what prisons really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they say i think that is maybe a little bit naive (sw4679A_0052)
in texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people (sw4679A_0054)
 it's kind of  hanging jury atmosphere (sw4679A_0056)
and a lot of places i think people bend over the other way (sw4679A_0058)
but i guess i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defend that gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to that (sw4679A_0059)
some some cases and some jurisdiction so they can do that (sw4679A_0060)
i kinda like that (sw4679A_0062)
uh-huh (sw4679A_0063)
yeah (sw4679A_0067)
yeah (sw4679A_0069)
right (sw4679A_0070)
lawyers blow sand in their eyes (sw4679A_0071)
i would like to see most civil cases tried before panel of experts instead of an ordinary juries (sw4679A_0074)
sure and cases and things like that (sw4679A_0077)
and  there'd be more honest settlements instead of this   talking of people's heart strings and  making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving him two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering (sw4679A_0080)
and i think in in criminal trials you need the jury as a defence against the government (sw4679A_0086)
but (sw4679A_0087)
okay (sw4679B_0002)
well i think the court systems could stand some improvement (sw4679B_0003)
 trial by a jury is good (sw4679B_0004)
a lot of time it a lot of cases  is circumstantial evidence that that convicts that person which i don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and improve person innocent i mean who person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have  a witness (sw4679B_0005)
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me (sw4679B_0006)
i don't know (sw4679B_0007)
i think so (sw4679B_0009)
right (sw4679B_0016)
they gave a verdict (sw4679B_0026)
you think your chances are better (sw4679B_0027)
well that's true (sw4679B_0032)
well sometime this and this and it still is not fair (sw4679B_0040)
i mean even if whether jury i guess they do decide to have (sw4679B_0041)
but but i'm like (sw4679B_0042)
a case like that most time it's (sw4679B_0043)
i don't know (sw4679B_0044)
my own to to   conservative when it come to that (sw4679B_0045)
is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases you know (sw4679B_0046)
right (sw4679B_0051)
yeah (sw4679B_0053)
right (sw4679B_0057)
 really (sw4679B_0061)
yeah (sw4679B_0064)
that's not a bad system (sw4679B_0065)
i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit (sw4679B_0066)
the thing is too maybe it any more  i don't know more of an expert types too to be on so many cases because most times you just pick you know joe blow whoever and  good citizen or whoever and call them (sw4679B_0068)
exactly (sw4679B_0073)
right (sw4679B_0075)
exactly (sw4679B_0076)
yeah (sw4679B_0078)
putting on an act or whatever (sw4679B_0082)
exactly (sw4679B_0084)
exactly (sw4679B_0085)
have you had that experience recently (sw4682A_0001)
 yeah (sw4682A_0007)
well i don't have so much trouble with products has service (sw4682A_0016)
i don't feel like that's a bigger problem (sw4682A_0018)
i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly (sw4682A_0019)
i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent (sw4682A_0021)
 the one i have now is okay most of the time (sw4682A_0023)
that's it (sw4682A_0025)
but that's that's probably the worst (sw4682A_0026)
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that guaranteed (sw4682A_0027)
james (sw4682A_0028)
i don't know if you have that up there (sw4682A_0029)
but it's it's a very good company themselves sterling silver things (sw4682A_0030)
 she has a charm bracelet lived lots of charms on a lot of money into it by now (sw4682A_0032)
and the catch broke (sw4682A_0035)
and she was sitting in school on a carpet (sw4682A_0036)
and when she stood up it caught and broke (sw4682A_0037)
we took it back (sw4682A_0038)
and they said  this was just obviously yang (sw4682A_0039)
this was yeah (sw4682A_0041)
i mean there were so rude about it (sw4682A_0042)
and so we wanted a different kind of cats (sw4682A_0044)
and she said well it's not guaranteed (sw4682A_0045)
i said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed (sw4682A_0046)
so do it anyway (sw4682A_0047)
so we got the kind we wanted (sw4682A_0049)
and i was really disappointed with that (sw4682A_0050)
felt that this was a company that should've been more reliable (sw4682A_0051)
and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends (sw4682A_0053)
i called there to see if they had (sw4682A_0054)
the lady was very nice (sw4682A_0055)
and i said my goodness (sw4682A_0056)
i said you've been very nice (sw4682A_0057)
what's your name (sw4682A_0058)
and she told me (sw4682A_0059)
and i said well i really appreciate it (sw4682A_0060)
said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store (sw4682A_0061)
and it turned out she was the assistant manager (sw4682A_0062)
so (sw4682A_0063)
right (sw4682A_0065)
so i felt kind of good about that you know (sw4682A_0066)
i didn't even know the person's name that it gave me the hard time or anything (sw4682A_0067)
but i just felt like well at least i did something (sw4682A_0070)
maybe they'll fix it (sw4682A_0071)
they might work on that you know (sw4682A_0072)
i find attitudes are more of a problem (sw4682A_0075)
service is more of a problem (sw4682A_0076)
yeah (sw4682A_0081)
that's really great (sw4682A_0088)
really good (sw4682A_0100)
used to be like that (sw4682A_0101)
yeah (sw4682A_0103)
i don't think most places are like that anymore (sw4682A_0104)
recently (sw4682B_0002)
i can't really say recently (sw4682B_0003)
but i think about  about a year ago  i bought a products from some company down at  in atlanta georgia (sw4682B_0004)
believe it was one of these  one of these these jews machines (sw4682B_0005)
and  the  the blade they sent me at first it was one of the machine is looked you know perfectly okay (sw4682B_0006)
but i've found that  it was made up some material which actually ended up rusting  after (sw4682B_0008)
you know despite you know delusion washing it after about three weeks of views (sw4682B_0010)
and i don't think it was my fault because you know i had made a point of like drawing it off and cleaning it (sw4682B_0011)
but  it was really  it was (sw4682B_0012)
i had to send it back after like three weeks i realize it was like it was not (sw4682B_0013)
something was very very wrong with the blade (sw4682B_0014)
 how 'bout you (sw4682B_0015)
at least you're talking to somebody who counts (sw4682B_0064)
yeah (sw4682B_0068)
yeah (sw4682B_0069)
right (sw4682B_0073)
right (sw4682B_0074)
yeah (sw4682B_0077)
up here in the northeast we have  well we we have these companies like l l being (sw4682B_0078)
and  they are famous for i guess we're having really top notch service (sw4682B_0079)
they've got  (sw4682B_0080)
i mean i've i've i i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally (sw4682B_0082)
i've heard stories where you can literally by something from them one year where it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept that in any condition (sw4682B_0083)
and they will gladly no questions asked to take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want any more (sw4682B_0084)
 they'll actually do things like that (sw4682B_0085)
i mean they're really they're they're good they bend over backwards service wise for you (sw4682B_0086)
i've  i found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call (sw4682B_0087)
you if you call the eight hundred number  you can call up you know eight eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get  the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies (sw4682B_0089)
and  actually i've tried that with a few companies lately (sw4682B_0090)
and they've both of them have been pretty good (sw4682B_0091)
but i i was (sw4682B_0092)
one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that  if you buy through bean or through (sw4682B_0093)
 i guess being is one of these big competitors is lands and out and  i guess it's wisconsin somewhere (sw4682B_0094)
they they are  they're very good about  ensure (sw4682B_0095)
the customers always right (sw4682B_0097)
and you know no matter how crappy you might be over the phone they are very understanding (sw4682B_0098)
and  they usually get you know they they make things or they make make sure things are said properly fewer anyway dissatisfied with their merchandise (sw4682B_0099)
i think i guess nowadays with the  with the economy the way it is i guess (sw4682B_0106)
there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are  you know (sw4682B_0107)
things are getting rough out there (sw4682B_0108)
there's a lot of you know (sw4682B_0109)
than the morale among the employees tends to go down (sw4682B_0110)
and that in turn like (sw4682B_0111)
well we in in in our family have been pretty reinvest and trying to  you know keep track of  daily finances (sw4688A_0001)
 the  way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know check books and all those kind of thing (sw4688A_0002)
and we kept that going for about a month (sw4688A_0003)
and it became so on or is that we gave up on it (sw4688A_0004)
so  the only thing where you know that we do now is  i keep  a little spread sheet of  what i called the net worth calculation which is just the the president value of various kinds of investments and so forth (sw4688A_0007)
 and i only update that i don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically go into statements come in you know just to see whether or not we're falling and you know getting ahead falling behind staying even or what (sw4688A_0008)
 that's really about you know the extent of  the kind of  financial scorekeeping that we're doing (sw4688A_0011)
 dear that's terrible (sw4688A_0016)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0019)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0021)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0026)
 i see (sw4688A_0027)
are you are you married (sw4688A_0028)
living with a bunch of with with people you're sharing expenses (sw4688A_0029)
i see (sw4688A_0033)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0034)
 dear (sw4688A_0037)
i see (sw4688A_0048)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0050)
 i see (sw4688A_0052)
 sure (sw4688A_0054)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0056)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0063)
yeah (sw4688A_0064)
the first you know  (sw4688A_0065)
my next door neighbor just lost his job and  you know one of these (sw4688A_0066)
this company went broke i mean when you know bankrupt (sw4688A_0068)
actually it was a subsidiary of  of an outfit called u s shoe or something (sw4688A_0069)
it was like computers subsidy (sw4688A_0070)
i don't know what a shoe companies doing renting a computer company (sw4688A_0071)
but  yeah they just they just folded up and   told him (sw4688A_0073)
they took the top management and gave them jobs with with the corporate  at the corporate front office (sw4688A_0074)
and everybody else was sent packing (sw4688A_0076)
 hang on one second (sw4688A_0078)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0079)
 so somebody was knocking on my door here (sw4688A_0081)
 it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present (sw4688A_0082)
i mean it sounds sounds terrible to say (sw4688A_0083)
but at the presents stage you probably are even more in the market for   budgetary thing than than than most people probably are might be terms of keeping keeping score of input announce (sw4688A_0084)
 do you have a computer at home (sw4688A_0088)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0093)
uh-huh (sw4688A_0095)
i see (sw4688A_0097)
yeah (sw4688A_0100)
have you do you use a standard  standard spreads (sw4688A_0101)
yeah (sw4688A_0102)
that sounds about right (sw4688B_0006)
right (sw4688B_0010)
well it's kinda difficult for me because right now  like most teachers i'm laid off (sw4688B_0013)
so  i spend most you know (sw4688B_0017)
i substituted a lot (sw4688B_0018)
so it's a lot it's very hard on a non fixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances (sw4688B_0020)
and but i know how much i have to bring in a month (sw4688B_0022)
and that's about it (sw4688B_0023)
that's about as far as weak (sw4688B_0024)
than anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us and just thrown in a kitty more or less for a rainy day (sw4688B_0025)
 no (sw4688B_0030)
i'm a single mother (sw4688B_0031)
i have three children (sw4688B_0032)
so  right now once we get you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it (sw4688B_0035)
my ex husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support (sw4688B_0036)
so right now i know what i'm getting from the state (sw4688B_0038)
and  i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and  you know try to work as many days as possible anytime they call me yeah (sw4688B_0039)
but i still have to figure out (sw4688B_0041)
if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid (sw4688B_0042)
and if i don't work enough days and i don't get enough to meet the bills (sw4688B_0043)
and it's like  juggling act every single month (sw4688B_0044)
like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me yeah (sw4688B_0046)
but they probably won't because next look the kids have school vacation (sw4688B_0047)
so you know the four days before they only have a four day week (sw4688B_0049)
and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in (sw4688B_0051)
they don't like to be absent before a vacation (sw4688B_0053)
but we're shopping around as far as well i'm shopping around as far as trying to get  that's why i'm doing this to get some extra money and  getting pledge sheets for the boy scouts (sw4688B_0055)
my kids are in boy scouts (sw4688B_0057)
so trying to get plugged sheets for the boy scouts (sw4688B_0058)
because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me (sw4688B_0059)
so it's so it helps to free the costs a little bit (sw4688B_0060)
but you know we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul (sw4688B_0061)
i guess we're in the situation than a lot of  you know middle class americans around (sw4688B_0062)
 my lord (sw4688B_0067)
really (sw4688B_0072)
sure (sw4688B_0080)
right (sw4688B_0085)
definitely (sw4688B_0087)
 yeah (sw4688B_0090)
to do (sw4688B_0091)
and we try to (sw4688B_0092)
i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in (sw4688B_0094)
every single day i'm at the computer (sw4688B_0096)
it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you know (sw4688B_0098)
yeah (sw4691A_0002)
i'm not ashamed to claim them this year as i have been (sw4691A_0003)
 yeah (sw4691A_0008)
right well (sw4691A_0009)
really (sw4691A_0011)
why (sw4691A_0013)
uh-huh (sw4691A_0016)
it'd be fun for you to watch up there anyway you see what happens now (sw4691A_0022)
uh-huh (sw4691A_0025)
right (sw4691A_0027)
well it depends on where you're from in texas (sw4691A_0029)
i live right by dallas (sw4691A_0030)
so we have one football team hardworking (sw4691A_0031)
how it is (sw4691A_0034)
divided (sw4691A_0036)
yeah (sw4691A_0037)
really is (sw4691A_0039)
so we've got our cowboys here (sw4691A_0040)
yeah i don't think anybody would it's different way (sw4691A_0041)
i have a boyfriend that lives in fresno (sw4691A_0043)
he is for the the raiders l a raiders (sw4691A_0045)
yeah (sw4691A_0047)
well i just started to this year because of these silly raiders that didn't do very well (sw4691A_0049)
i've been trying more this year (sw4691A_0050)
i think i know a little more than i used to (sw4691A_0051)
i never knew very much at all (sw4691A_0053)
so i'm trying (sw4691A_0054)
yeah (sw4691A_0056)
 i shouldn't even try to do it (sw4691A_0063)
yeah (sw4691A_0066)
right (sw4691A_0069)
yeah (sw4691A_0073)
yeah (sw4691A_0079)
i don't even think we have that in (sw4691A_0081)
my (sw4691A_0083)
do we (sw4691A_0084)
i mean (sw4691A_0085)
 probably know (sw4691A_0086)
i don't know (sw4691A_0087)
nobody talks about it (sw4691A_0091)
i don't think (sw4691A_0092)
now (sw4691A_0094)
uh-huh (sw4691A_0095)
we have a soccer team that comes and goes (sw4691A_0096)
we don't even have that very much (sw4691A_0097)
so (sw4691A_0098)
yeah (sw4691A_0105)
yeah (sw4691A_0115)
yeah (sw4691A_0117)
well i like to do (sw4691A_0118)
i don't like to watch (sw4691A_0119)
like to watch anything (sw4691A_0122)
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of t v and watch all this stuff (sw4691A_0123)
think it's an excuse to do nothing (sw4691A_0124)
and i i can see what you're saying about the male bonding (sw4691A_0125)
and the guys get together (sw4691A_0126)
and that's kinda cool (sw4691A_0128)
that's fun (sw4691A_0129)
but it can get really over (sw4691A_0131)
yeah (sw4691A_0133)
yeah (sw4691A_0134)
yeah (sw4691A_0136)

but i still had a good time (sw4691A_0182)
well (sw4691B_0004)
let's put it this way (sw4691B_0005)
we've got the new england patriots up here (sw4691B_0006)
so (sw4691B_0007)
they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years (sw4691B_0010)
yeah (sw4691B_0012)
 well  partly due to own a ship (sw4691B_0014)
you know  the guy him on the  the patriots  for a period of a number of years (sw4691B_0015)
he always had this  this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth everytime he went to say something (sw4691B_0017)
and  they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth (sw4691B_0018)
recently was sold to  some other people (sw4691B_0019)
so hopefully this ownership can set up a new direction and  keep the patriots in the new england area anyway (sw4691B_0020)
 yeah (sw4691B_0023)
i've been to a couple of i've been to a few games before (sw4691B_0024)
you you're you're from texas (sw4691B_0026)
so you've got two football teams down there (sw4691B_0028)
uh-huh (sw4691B_0032)
 i see (sw4691B_0033)
that type of segregation  (sw4691B_0035)
wow (sw4691B_0038)
uh-huh (sw4691B_0042)
do you (sw4691B_0044)
do you follow professional sports at all (sw4691B_0048)
yeah (sw4691B_0052)
well it's a good pastime you know (sw4691B_0055)
particularly football (sw4691B_0057)
they say  football attracts more men because of the you know you see the the physical aggression on the field (sw4691B_0058)
supposedly psychologist say that  that  men take off their frustrations by watching football (sw4691B_0059)
you know they get together with a bunch of guys (sw4691B_0060)
and they   and they have a good time and everything (sw4691B_0061)
and that's supposed to be some of the or the male bonding in the in the  the male instincts i guess or something about  (sw4691B_0062)
well no (sw4691B_0064)
it's good as it terms of   in terms of  of a contest (sw4691B_0065)
i think that  i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport (sw4691B_0067)
it hasn't speed (sw4691B_0068)
in the hand eye coordination (sw4691B_0070)
takes a certain skill to play hockey (sw4691B_0071)
not everybody can play hockey (sw4691B_0072)
so (sw4691B_0074)
uh-huh (sw4691B_0076)
we're a big hockey area up here (sw4691B_0077)
fed up here in new england as well as you know like men in minnesota (sw4691B_0078)
but (sw4691B_0080)
hockey (sw4691B_0082)
yeah (sw4691B_0089)
there's no professional hockey teams in in in in texas (sw4691B_0093)
yeah (sw4691B_0099)
i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now (sw4691B_0100)
like they have this world football league (sw4691B_0102)
yeah (sw4691B_0103)
we have the n f l that that dallas in houston i ran a new england patriots in l a raiders and those teams (sw4691B_0104)
there were those teams that play on professional national football league (sw4691B_0106)
but  now they have what's called the world football league (sw4691B_0107)
and they have all these teams from (sw4691B_0108)
there's a team in london (sw4691B_0109)
there's a team isn't isn't  teams and other european teams (sw4691B_0110)
and his team's united states (sw4691B_0112)
and and they're playing now during the summer months (sw4691B_0113)
it's really you know overkill (sw4691B_0114)
and there's only so much football you can watch (sw4691B_0116)
yeah (sw4691B_0120)
that's good (sw4691B_0121)
yeah (sw4691B_0127)
now have you ever been to a professional football game (sw4691B_0132)
yeah (sw4691B_0135)
did you do the whole big the whole thing the tailgate party and (sw4691B_0139)
see i see now that's what he got to do (sw4691B_0142)
we talked to (sw4691B_0143)
yeah (sw4691B_0145)
yeah (sw4691B_0146)
but at the same thing (sw4691B_0149)
we talked out why (sw4691B_0151)
about six or eight guys and we used to go out to these games (sw4691B_0152)
and we talked about whether it's one time (sw4691B_0153)
and they had a real good time (sw4691B_0154)
it was basically for the social atmosphere (sw4691B_0155)
you go you know three or four hours before the game (sw4691B_0158)
set up (sw4691B_0159)
at a table (sw4691B_0160)
do some cooking and barbecueing have a few drinks and then going to see the game and see the pages losing and go home and he drinks and (sw4691B_0161)
but that whole (sw4691B_0163)
it's not so much shorter contest itself in the game itself (sw4691B_0164)
it's the whole atmosphere of playing  of going to a game (sw4691B_0165)
yeah (sw4691B_0166)
that you miss sitting home and your color you know  what it would have a six pack of beer and some of (sw4691B_0168)
you missed that (sw4691B_0170)
in in any professional sport i think you miss that (sw4691B_0173)
the atmosphere of being there (sw4691B_0175)
yup (sw4691B_0179)
well the question was talking about the juries (sw4697A_0001)
and  one of the things i thought that was on a lot of the drunk cases that they were having especially for repeat offenders that  (sw4697A_0002)
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again (sw4697A_0003)
 so that  a judge i think it would be the most appropriate person to  to be able to send it somebody since they do it over and over again every day (sw4697A_0004)
right (sw4697A_0007)
yeah (sw4697A_0013)
see i agree with you (sw4697A_0014)
 one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have  a mock court (sw4697A_0015)
and we supposed to be all legal and everything (sw4697A_0016)
present your case (sw4697A_0018)
the other side president's their case (sw4697A_0019)
and you're done with it (sw4697A_0020)
almost like a night court we see on t v (sw4697A_0021)
 and  but it's not that we have  (sw4697A_0023)
it didn't back log or all of the  the cases that are already pin (sw4697A_0024)
 so (sw4697A_0025)
that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way (sw4697A_0026)
yes (sw4697A_0029)
yeah (sw4697A_0030)
sure (sw4697A_0038)
 yeah (sw4697A_0042)
and i wasn't i didn't mean bad (sw4697A_0043)
i didn't mean that (sw4697A_0046)
because i mean gee whiz if i was   didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that (sw4697A_0048)
i would feel  you're right that my civil rights had been (sw4697A_0051)
but i meant for some when both parties agree that yes we are going to have a judge here (sw4697A_0052)
we're not going to have a jury (sw4697A_0053)
let's get it over with (sw4697A_0054)
so like car accidents you know (sw4697A_0055)
yeah (sw4697A_0058)
right (sw4697A_0062)
right (sw4697A_0063)
right (sw4697A_0068)
giving a difference (sw4697A_0069)
okay (sw4697A_0071)
right (sw4697A_0072)
well i and we're at liberty to to talk and and as long as all in the same thing (sw4697A_0077)
right (sw4697A_0083)
right (sw4697A_0084)
uh-huh (sw4697A_0089)
uh-huh (sw4697A_0090)
right (sw4697A_0094)
right (sw4697A_0095)
yeah (sw4697A_0096)
wait until i haven't been into many jury or anything like that (sw4697A_0097)
yeah (sw4697A_0099)
well i was called once when i was nineteen (sw4697A_0100)
and  but i was doing so many other things that they took penny on me (sw4697A_0102)
and i was doing school and things like (sw4697A_0103)
they they'll let me out (sw4697A_0104)
and i never had to do it since (sw4697A_0106)
and that was almost twenty years ago (sw4697A_0107)
uh-huh (sw4697A_0113)
how interesting (sw4697A_0123)
uh-huh (sw4697A_0126)
right (sw4697B_0005)
i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases  the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed (sw4697B_0006)
 i i think that in some cases that's considered prejudice that current case (sw4697B_0008)
so   judge your rights should have the whole of the criminal there (sw4697B_0010)
and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give inappropriate  sentence (sw4697B_0012)
in other words not not (sw4697B_0027)
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial (sw4697B_0028)
i i don't (sw4697B_0032)
there's a point on which we don't agree (sw4697B_0033)
i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime anytime of one of the parties wants one (sw4697B_0035)
usually it's the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case (sw4697B_0037)
so i'm not up for streamlining things to the point where we  take that (sw4697B_0039)
that would require changing the bill of rights i believe (sw4697B_0040)
 okay (sw4697B_0045)
right (sw4697B_0056)
well i think that's already possible (sw4697B_0057)
i think that you can wave the right to a jury trial (sw4697B_0059)
yeah (sw4697B_0061)
so i agree that that should be encouraged (sw4697B_0064)
people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial (sw4697B_0066)
but i think most lawyers do a pretty good jobs making that evident to to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into giving a different sense or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher  you know awards if money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award (sw4697B_0067)
yeah (sw4697B_0073)
and i suspect in cases like (sw4697B_0074)
i guess we were supposed to be doing criminal though rather than civil (sw4697B_0075)
is that right (sw4697B_0076)
yeah (sw4697B_0078)
well  in the case of civil  things i think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyers advantage (sw4697B_0080)
and i think that maybe where jury uses overdone (sw4697B_0081)
i mean there are cases would that could be settled maybe out of court in a little more efficiently (sw4697B_0082)
but the lawyers are really  (sw4697B_0085)
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience is possible (sw4697B_0086)
so  i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards and civil cases not just sentencing and in  criminal cases (sw4697B_0088)
 i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that (sw4697B_0091)
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases (sw4697B_0092)
so there's a difference of my view there for those too (sw4697B_0093)
have you ever had to serve jury duty (sw4697B_0098)
uh-huh (sw4697B_0105)
uh-huh (sw4697B_0108)
it is (sw4697B_0109)
sort of amazed me (sw4697B_0110)
they first caught up with me for the first time and  (sw4697B_0111)
that would have been about  twenty years too (sw4697B_0112)
 just last year (sw4697B_0114)
and  the case i heard was a criminal case (sw4697B_0115)
and it seemed really trivial (sw4697B_0116)
involved too bicycles (sw4697B_0117)
we didn't do the senate (sw4697B_0119)
the judge did (sw4697B_0120)
so (sw4697B_0122)
 rented a verdict (sw4697B_0124)
and then the judge was the one to do this and that (sw4697B_0125)
and that was here in wisconsin (sw4697B_0128)
so i i don't know if that varies from state to state or (sw4697B_0129)
actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time  in computers (sw4698A_0001)
and i have really resisted they impulse to get one for the home  up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago (sw4698A_0002)
i got one for my son   macintosh  l c (sw4698A_0004)
it's a really easy to use color  computer (sw4698A_0006)
and i got a very nice picture that goes along with it (sw4698A_0007)
he uses it for his schoolwork (sw4698A_0008)
where are you going to school (sw4698A_0021)
i see (sw4698A_0023)
in engineering (sw4698A_0026)
so that explains all the  computer assignments (sw4698A_0028)
do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work (sw4698A_0031)
no (sw4698A_0038)
yeah (sw4698A_0039)
i just have one for my son (sw4698A_0040)
i really sort of had the feeling that word processing is a big market for home computing (sw4698A_0041)
at work   i am  technologist (sw4698A_0045)
and i in the past i've done a great deal of of  system of development just through a software development programming (sw4698A_0046)
 but now i find myself using the computer (sw4698A_0047)
even the computer work is primarily a  word processing system and communication system (sw4698A_0048)
yes (sw4698A_0053)
email is probably pulls down a third of all my time (sw4698A_0054)
well i'm an old timer (sw4698A_0071)
i did my masters thesis on a typewriter (sw4698A_0072)
yeah i rented an i b m's electric (sw4698A_0074)
and that was a pretty big deal (sw4698A_0076)
yeah (sw4698A_0085)
 well you know it's just it was just completely different world (sw4698A_0086)
i like it (sw4698A_0090)
yeah (sw4698A_0091)
i like it from a distance (sw4698A_0092)
i see the packages on it  that are available (sw4698A_0093)
that's nice (sw4698A_0094)
i really don't use it myself (sw4698A_0095)
 i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things (sw4698A_0097)
 so i let my son to it (sw4698A_0100)
 of course you know there's a there's a intellectual evolution taking place where (sw4698A_0101)
it's sort of a joke (sw4698A_0103)
but it's really true (sw4698A_0104)
the old timers even the people who are technology just don't know how to operate these electronic things like v c r's and whatnot (sw4698A_0105)
and the kids they just take to it like candy (sw4698A_0106)
 currently in school (sw4698B_0010)
i have i've had an i b m i guess for a couple of years now which i've been trying to continually upgrading i guess (sw4698B_0011)
and  i found i found that i pretty much become addicted to it (sw4698B_0012)
i can't really (sw4698B_0013)
i found them most of my homework assignments  at the live on that really require some computer  simulation or announcers (sw4698B_0014)
yeah (sw4698B_0015)
very central for me (sw4698B_0017)
schools have them (sw4698B_0018)
 but a lot of times so difficult to get on them at school (sw4698B_0019)
it's very easy to much more convenient to have one at home (sw4698B_0020)
at georgia tech (sw4698B_0022)
yeah (sw4698B_0024)
yeah (sw4698B_0025)
yes actually (sw4698B_0027)
yeah (sw4698B_0029)
uh-huh (sw4698B_0030)
sure (sw4698B_0032)
i have some games of course which i play on there (sw4698B_0033)
and   i have a program which allows me to excess   whether data bank (sw4698B_0034)
so i can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever to the hobby (sw4698B_0035)
so it it provides other means other than just strict  you know computations and so on (sw4698B_0036)
so have you do have a computer for yourself (sw4698B_0037)
 yeah (sw4698B_0042)
yeah (sw4698B_0043)
yeah (sw4698B_0044)
yeah (sw4698B_0050)
yeah (sw4698B_0051)
do you use email and like that (sw4698B_0052)
yeah (sw4698B_0055)
that's (sw4698B_0056)
i  i have a (sw4698B_0057)
so i can log into the the  network at georgia tech can access my accounts there which is which can be useful (sw4698B_0058)
but  (sw4698B_0059)
then word processing (sw4698B_0060)
well i tend to (sw4698B_0061)
i mean obviously i do most of my almost all my report writing then on my computer so whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments (sw4698B_0062)
so it's really become really come a mainstay i guess (sw4698B_0064)
i can't even remember (sw4698B_0065)
i actually don't think i've ever used a typewriter in my life to do it  do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a basic computer  terrorists eighty when they first came out (sw4698B_0066)
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high (sw4698B_0068)
 yeah (sw4698B_0073)
yeah (sw4698B_0077)
i must have been (sw4698B_0078)
a little bit strange for me (sw4698B_0079)
i did my masters thesis  last year (sw4698B_0080)
and i did that on the computer (sw4698B_0081)
and it seems like (sw4698B_0082)
i just can't imagine how people that have before (sw4698B_0083)
i spend so much so much work (sw4698B_0084)
yeah (sw4698B_0087)
so  you know you you you used  your son's mackintosh then (sw4698B_0088)
do you find that you liked kind of computer (sw4698B_0089)
yeah (sw4698B_0098)
yeah (sw4698B_0102)
yeah (sw4698B_0107)
well it if if if the interface it there so that it's like funding using a challenge (sw4698B_0108)
i would i'd turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon (sw4707A_0003)
eating (sw4707A_0007)
yeah (sw4707A_0012)
they what (sw4707A_0013)
they what we can do is  i can punch the  one (sw4707A_0015)
after five minutes when they  a voice comes on we can talk all night if we want (sw4707A_0016)
 i love the irony of  talking about this subject on april fifteenth (sw4707A_0020)
but  i'm afraid i'm i'm probably in the minority (sw4707A_0021)
i actually don't think that we are paid too much in this country   particularly  in this part of the country (sw4707A_0022)
 i guess i do have a  a bone to pick with   the white tax or distributed (sw4707A_0024)
 i just finished fuming at the fact that we paying eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax one income tax could have been deducted from the federal form (sw4707A_0025)
and the sales tax cats (sw4707A_0027)
i think that's regrets (sw4707A_0028)
  it's kinda dumb (sw4707A_0029)
well i mean nobody can taxes grill yeah (sw4707A_0033)
yeah (sw4707A_0036)
is that right (sw4707A_0038)
right (sw4707A_0042)
but i guess when i hear when i see the comparison between united states and  any other western country  their their rights are like  forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven (sw4707A_0045)
few computer as a percentage of totally income all taxes lump together we actually do pretty well (sw4707A_0046)
there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are (sw4707A_0047)
yeah (sw4707A_0049)
uh-huh (sw4707A_0050)
i'm not sure i understand what you mean (sw4707A_0051)
right (sw4707A_0054)
 you mean lower standard of living in spite of  higher (sw4707A_0056)
yeah (sw4707A_0057)
i suppose that's true (sw4707A_0060)
yeah (sw4707A_0061)
 probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever (sw4707A_0062)
but (sw4707A_0063)
yeah (sw4707A_0065)
right (sw4707A_0067)
right (sw4707A_0071)
right (sw4707A_0073)
yeah (sw4707A_0074)
yeah (sw4707A_0075)
since then i send my kids to parochial school that's (sw4707A_0076)
it's not it's not quite the bargain (sw4707A_0079)
but i mean i pay them gladly (sw4707A_0080)
that's a decision (sw4707A_0081)
i think it's a dump decision on our part because countries like canada in england and germany do perfectly well with a  to track system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money (sw4707A_0082)
but  i mean that's the that's the way that americans want to interpret it (sw4707A_0083)
i guess that's all right (sw4707A_0084)
but (sw4707A_0085)
yeah (sw4707A_0086)
and if i were (sw4707A_0088)
when i was single and again when i'm retired i will not mind paying  what it takes to keep the schools (sw4707A_0089)
that's always been high priority (sw4707A_0090)
i do (sw4707A_0093)
that's true (sw4707A_0095)
i think in places i think in places like california people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the   people are very  sexual and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are  just look in front of the people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens (sw4707A_0096)
and  they're big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done (sw4707A_0098)
that seems so  like a cultural laps (sw4707A_0099)
i mean people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools (sw4707A_0100)
that (sw4707A_0101)
yeah (sw4707A_0104)
people would rather  increased the fire department and cut down the schools it means more to (sw4707A_0105)
but i think it's  built around selfish and short sighted (sw4707A_0106)
yeah (sw4707A_0109)
not very good (sw4707B_0001)
good (sw4707B_0002)
right (sw4707B_0004)
i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn (sw4707B_0005)
so i hope she's turned in (sw4707B_0006)
i just (sw4707B_0008)
go ahead (sw4707B_0009)
stop eating (sw4707B_0010)
i got home from university (sw4707B_0011)
i just barely got home from the university (sw4707B_0014)
okay (sw4707B_0017)
go ahead (sw4707B_0018)
fire away (sw4707B_0019)
i agree with you (sw4707B_0023)
i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax (sw4707B_0030)
but then when the other hand i don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like groceries (sw4707B_0031)
it's not on that (sw4707B_0032)
 yeah (sw4707B_0034)
they do (sw4707B_0035)
in arizona (sw4707B_0037)
well we have a pretty low income i mean pretty low tax rate here (sw4707B_0040)
 i think that the sales tax they just got to do something about it (sw4707B_0041)
but that's the political instead of trying to not creating a new taxes (sw4707B_0043)
well and i still think having lived in europe for a while you know the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth  four we pay for (sw4707B_0048)
well i think (sw4707B_0052)
i lived in germany you know for several years (sw4707B_0053)
a lot rather pay taxes here and have a we have wouldn't have to live there (sw4707B_0055)
higher taxes (sw4707B_0058)
so that way to some extent (sw4707B_0064)
the other problem is you know it's it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you'd theoretically can do something about (sw4707B_0066)
but i look for example (sw4707B_0068)
you're not quite the same situation (sw4707B_0069)
like school taxes for me because bargain in the world (sw4707B_0070)
she didn't have to pay any more physician in a year and i had to pay for all of my school taxes (sw4707B_0072)
yeah (sw4707B_0077)
that's probably a little tougher on you (sw4707B_0078)
yeah (sw4707B_0091)
that's just you though (sw4707B_0092)
yeah (sw4707B_0097)
i think with a grain of america we're going to see that problem in lots of places (sw4707B_0102)
or build roads (sw4707B_0107)
 i think  (sw4720A_0001)
actually i'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have   working for a large corporation (sw4720A_0002)
for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefits (sw4720A_0003)
i think it's healthcare (sw4720A_0005)
everybody would say that (sw4720A_0007)
right (sw4720A_0009)
belong to a group is  belong to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have (sw4720A_0010)
 the yeah (sw4720A_0012)
sometimes i think it's more important than a salary (sw4720A_0013)
yes (sw4720A_0015)
and  i don't know if i ranked second (sw4720A_0016)
but  since i have three boys  it it can turn out to be important (sw4720A_0017)
yeah (sw4720A_0019)
right now in a given year dental dental expenses couldn't really care (sw4720A_0021)
yeah (sw4720A_0028)
yeah (sw4720A_0029)
right (sw4720A_0031)
yeah and then   if the clinton doesn't get to the arcade only will (sw4720A_0032)
 i guess that would be up there (sw4720A_0035)
 i'm not sure if i would rank  how i would write that next  say compared to retirement (sw4720A_0036)
or    protects savings is another thing that i think is  a great great benefit (sw4720A_0037)
i think it's really something that they  the government ought to encourage more because  they're all these complaints about how we are not a saving country and where the average savings ready to something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in  germany and japan (sw4720A_0040)
right (sw4720A_0044)
when you have the when you have the  the economies of scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can  offer some incentive (sw4720A_0045)
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really built up  the settings you know that you wouldn't otherwise do (sw4720A_0046)
leave (sw4720A_0051)
you know i'd i don't think so yeah (sw4720A_0054)
they may have  just plain parental leave would see the one can take (sw4720A_0055)
yeah i they're  i know they're maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short  (sw4720A_0057)
  i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks (sw4720A_0059)
right (sw4720A_0061)
and  (sw4720A_0062)
there ought to be   some compromise that could where at where the person would be guaranteed a  career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position  in exchange for a longer period of time (sw4720A_0066)
 it's so important to families and (sw4720A_0070)
and  and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up (sw4720A_0071)
yeah (sw4720A_0077)
right (sw4720A_0078)
i think you put your finger on the one benefit  with most like to see  changed  the  parental leave (sw4720A_0079)
right (sw4720A_0085)
yeah (sw4720A_0090)
they do it by short changing their kids (sw4720A_0091)
no other way i mean unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely (sw4720A_0092)
people moving as much (sw4720A_0097)
and  they're just it's just a terrible (sw4720A_0098)
shouldn't have to make (sw4720A_0099)
right (sw4720A_0101)
 right (sw4720A_0104)
wow (sw4720A_0105)
i like to have that (sw4720A_0106)
yeah (sw4720A_0108)
 that's (sw4720A_0111)
friends and a lot of different city (sw4720A_0112)
you just fly me they're all take care of that (sw4720A_0113)
right (sw4720A_0117)
and  i guess (sw4720A_0118)
right (sw4720B_0004)
 and then if you try to get it outside of your  corporations are going to pay an arm and a line (sw4720B_0008)
right (sw4720B_0011)
do you also get dental (sw4720B_0014)
 i know (sw4720B_0020)
and then my husband's with the north west airlines (sw4720B_0022)
and he gets up you know the full health and dental (sw4720B_0023)
and  we have four children (sw4720B_0024)
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous (sw4720B_0025)
and i don't know how people that don't have it can afford it (sw4720B_0027)
or maybe they don't (sw4720B_0030)
that's right (sw4720B_0033)
that's right (sw4720B_0034)
right (sw4720B_0039)
right (sw4720B_0042)
well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on at first (sw4720B_0043)
right (sw4720B_0047)
what about what about  lesser  benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the  corporations (sw4720B_0049)
for example   (sw4720B_0050)
yeah (sw4720B_0052)
do they even have do they have father leaves or anything like that (sw4720B_0053)
uh-huh (sw4720B_0056)
 i do too (sw4720B_0058)
 i think i think it's just a crying shame  for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks (sw4720B_0060)
she hasn't recovered (sw4720B_0063)
and the the infant names are desperately at that point in time (sw4720B_0064)
right (sw4720B_0068)
i agree (sw4720B_0069)
 sure (sw4720B_0072)
especially in this day and age (sw4720B_0074)
you don't want to start over again anywhere (sw4720B_0076)
well i think they're they're they've come a long way (sw4720B_0080)
at least some companies (sw4720B_0082)
some of them  (sw4720B_0083)
my girlfriend in particular who works for a rental car agency (sw4720B_0084)
and  as a manager and  they have very very poorly policy (sw4720B_0086)
and  i just don't know how how women do it (sw4720B_0087)
particularly single parents who don't have the support of the other end (sw4720B_0088)
that's right (sw4720B_0094)
that's exactly right (sw4720B_0095)
right (sw4720B_0096)
one of the benefits we get a courses travel (sw4720B_0103)
that's wonderful (sw4720B_0107)
you know like travel is that you can afford to go anywhere (sw4720B_0109)
get afford to stay when she get there (sw4720B_0110)
you have to have an awful lot of fun (sw4720B_0115)
just getting marriage has to be half the fun (sw4720B_0116)
regarding the taxes (sw4725A_0001)
taxes are really a necessary evil and and  civilized society (sw4725A_0002)
but really people get upset at texas because he gets more efficient to do things for yourself (sw4725A_0003)
and  and so as as a result  you know it's it's a trade off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know (sw4725A_0005)
how much of your resource should you dedicate to  making things work for others (sw4725A_0006)
have you  you ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it (sw4725A_0007)
well the thing of it is if i wanted to just  you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just  you know  go on public assistance  you know look look look for  look for people to  to take care of me (sw4725A_0012)
and  probably a good woman (sw4725A_0015)
right (sw4725A_0016)
just you know just just kind somebody to take care of me (sw4725A_0018)
any and then you don't have to be on the tax (sw4725A_0019)
but  but taxes are very difficult to kind of thing (sw4725A_0021)
everybody really hates it (sw4725A_0022)
it was very timely (sw4725A_0023)
i i always over pay my mighty ducks (sw4725A_0024)
so i wind up with my getting money back on my  from my  withholding (sw4725A_0025)
so  you know that that's always a smile (sw4725A_0027)
but of course you know i've i've (sw4725A_0028)
and i should calculated better (sw4725A_0029)
yeah (sw4725A_0033)
i i i worked for the f b i (sw4725A_0034)
so i i'm a federal employee (sw4725A_0036)
yeah (sw4725A_0038)
guess i don't sound like it  (sw4725A_0039)
yeah (sw4725A_0044)
i've got all four feet in the trust you know being a federal employee (sw4725A_0046)
and so but but i can understand that  that you know the  who gets benefits (sw4725A_0048)
every time there is a a bond issue you know voting on every one of them (sw4725A_0049)
i (sw4725A_0052)
but but but this is this is tax not tax revolt country (sw4725A_0053)
i mean there's too many (sw4725A_0054)
every one of us most of us have i have all four feet in the trust you know plus our snout right up to our ears (sw4725A_0055)
so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to you know get into a tax revolt situation (sw4725A_0057)
but   the  the local taxes here i i in this particular area  you know i've  i think i pay about  thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know yeah which is a lot of money (sw4725A_0059)
and  and so is is people get older and older  you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing (sw4725A_0061)
and they've they're building old peoples homes  you know tax expense (sw4725A_0063)
well i think you know the old people and just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper (sw4725A_0064)
thirty three hundred dollars that they're thirty five hundred dollars i'm paying taxes well i i could go down to probably rent a rent a house for that right (sw4725A_0065)
you know and instead it's it's the taxes here (sw4725A_0068)
course i don't know whether i want to go to to or not you know again or someplace like that (sw4725A_0071)
but  there's certainly lots of an expensive places where the services are poor (sw4725A_0074)
and i and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay just to move to an area where the services are poor (sw4725A_0075)
if you're not going to use them and you want to be in a in an environment (sw4725A_0076)
that's a strategy i think that the people you know have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living (sw4725A_0077)
i have a five or six years before i'm eligible to retire (sw4725A_0078)
and and i'm saying well you know i really can't stay here  as a retiree (sw4725A_0079)
it's too expensive (sw4725A_0082)
i'm going to have to go out and you know and you know east fork someplace and and and do my thing (sw4725A_0084)
right (sw4725A_0091)
they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five (sw4725A_0092)
and they're not doing any again you know (sw4725A_0094)
 well it certainly   (sw4725A_0096)
you must be a t i employee (sw4725A_0097)
you must be a t i employee (sw4725A_0099)
you're not a (sw4725A_0102)
what do you work (sw4725A_0103)
yeah (sw4725A_0108)
right (sw4725B_0004)
 well yeah (sw4725B_0008)
no it's it's a lot too you know that  that i feel like you know and just like you said that it there's just so much that you could do yourself that you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for (sw4725B_0009)
but they're giving it to other people that don't really needed any either (sw4725B_0010)
but yet they accept it (sw4725B_0011)
like so many people do (sw4725B_0013)
uh-huh (sw4725B_0014)
right (sw4725B_0020)
uh-huh (sw4725B_0026)
you are you in business for yourself (sw4725B_0031)
okay (sw4725B_0035)
right (sw4725B_0037)
 well i think (sw4725B_0040)
yeah (sw4725B_0041)
i think that people that work for the government or just as against taxes as as everybody else you know (sw4725B_0042)
unless you worked for internal revenue (sw4725B_0043)
yeah (sw4725B_0047)
right (sw4725B_0051)
yeah (sw4725B_0056)
right (sw4725B_0060)
yeah (sw4725B_0066)
that's right (sw4725B_0067)
yeah (sw4725B_0073)
after i retire (sw4725B_0080)
yeah (sw4725B_0081)
yeah (sw4725B_0083)
and (sw4725B_0085)
my parents were in the same situation you know (sw4725B_0086)
they they're home is paid for (sw4725B_0087)
but still their taxes are so high that you know my father does it feel like you can retire because they couldn't pay the taxes (sw4725B_0088)
and they have no children in school or you know anything (sw4725B_0089)
they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards (sw4725B_0090)
yeah (sw4725B_0093)
yeah (sw4725B_0095)
you must be what (sw4725B_0098)
i'm not (sw4725B_0101)
i i don't work (sw4725B_0104)
i'm a student (sw4725B_0105)
i go to school (sw4725B_0106)
in nursing school (sw4725B_0107)
 i have a ford pick up (sw4728A_0003)
and  the family cars yeah  dodge caravan okay and  'cause we have three kids and they're under thirteen (sw4728A_0004)
so  (sw4728A_0006)
they sort of fit our requirements (sw4728A_0008)
i have  one of those  pick up with that  with a seat in the back (sw4728A_0010)
and so they just fit in there (sw4728A_0013)
and they get to be teenagers with long legs that may not work (sw4728A_0014)
right now i can right now i can throw 'em on the back when we have room (sw4728A_0016)
and  hey go since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back (sw4728A_0017)
and i kind of like having to pick up truck (sw4728A_0019)
actually i think of it as a as a car that will last (sw4728A_0022)
i like the white trucks or (sw4728A_0026)
and i don't care about comfort (sw4728A_0027)
so i'm pretty yeah (sw4728A_0028)
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one (sw4728A_0034)
i i never buy new (sw4728A_0035)
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another use drugs (sw4728A_0036)
and  (sw4728A_0039)
i don't i don't i don't need to pay for the glitz (sw4728A_0040)
 no let somebody else  have the showroom showing (sw4728A_0041)
i'll pay for the rest of it (sw4728A_0043)
right (sw4728A_0046)
and  the van were (sw4728A_0047)
we might go again on a on a van (sw4728A_0048)
we could probably do with   something just a little bit larger that compact innocent and next time (sw4728A_0049)
i'm not sure (sw4728A_0050)
we have to we will have to face it in a couple of years (sw4728A_0052)
but  i i guess we had a small toyota wagon (sw4728A_0053)
and we were real happy with that because  my my second requirement after prices are low maintenance (sw4728A_0055)
and  but it's certainly had that (sw4728A_0057)
we didn't do much to it at all (sw4728A_0058)
uh-huh (sw4728A_0060)
uh-huh (sw4728A_0072)
uh-huh (sw4728A_0077)
yeah (sw4728A_0082)
moderate real early and how many miles (sw4728A_0086)
you didn't overheated (sw4728A_0090)
 that was that (sw4728A_0099)
uh-huh (sw4728A_0103)
yeah (sw4728A_0104)
i have one colleague that commute to work on one when it's not raining (sw4728A_0109)
 he's  (sw4728A_0110)
that's (sw4728A_0111)
he's pretty conservative guy (sw4728A_0112)
i don't think it's much of a sport for  (sw4728A_0113)
i guess (sw4728A_0114)
i'm sure he does (sw4728A_0117)
yeah (sw4728A_0118)
nah (sw4728A_0124)
yeah (sw4728A_0126)
yeah (sw4728A_0128)
right (sw4728A_0132)
finally had some place that i could store the carrot top i would have it off most of the time (sw4728A_0138)
really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way to have another landed on the ground and gets thirty (sw4728A_0140)
but  yeah they're solid (sw4728A_0143)
trucks of built  (sw4728A_0144)
they're the only things americans still know how to build (sw4728A_0146)
yeah (sw4728A_0147)
yeah (sw4728A_0156)
right (sw4728A_0158)
i kinda like (sw4728A_0159)
yeah (sw4728A_0160)
the minds of four (sw4728A_0161)
 i heard about that (sw4728A_0166)
yeah (sw4728A_0167)
yeah (sw4728A_0169)
well that that's a serious (sw4728A_0171)
right (sw4728A_0175)
this  (sw4728A_0176)
i know a contractor who just got one of them (sw4728A_0177)
pleased with it (sw4728A_0179)
i don't know what you're driving now (sw4728B_0001)
i mean what do you drive now (sw4728B_0002)
 okay (sw4728B_0005)
throw 'em in the back (sw4728B_0007)
cats (sw4728B_0011)
 yeah (sw4728B_0012)
there you go (sw4728B_0018)
yeah (sw4728B_0020)
yeah (sw4728B_0021)
right (sw4728B_0023)
yeah (sw4728B_0024)
i know (sw4728B_0025)
yeah (sw4728B_0029)
i got to tell you the foreigners (sw4728B_0031)
i wanted a truck but i i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too (sw4728B_0032)
so i got a foreigner (sw4728B_0033)
yeah just like (sw4728B_0037)
i'd never bought a new vehicle in my life (sw4728B_0038)
now (sw4728B_0042)
that somebody else break it in (sw4728B_0044)
yeah (sw4728B_0045)
yeah (sw4728B_0051)
right (sw4728B_0054)
right (sw4728B_0056)
yeah (sw4728B_0061)
 my (sw4728B_0062)
pretty much (sw4728B_0063)
i got  like i said i got one of those two to four hundred (sw4728B_0064)
and  it pretty much does everything i needed to (sw4728B_0066)
it'll tell us three thousand pounds (sw4728B_0067)
so i can tell everything (sw4728B_0068)
i can throw (sw4728B_0070)
i've had eleven people in it for leave or not (sw4728B_0071)
and  it's real reliable (sw4728B_0073)
blue (sw4728B_0074)
i mean i've had it for almost four years now (sw4728B_0075)
up until  say two weeks ago it had never had anything (sw4728B_0076)
and then of course two weeks ago it decided (sw4728B_0078)
yeah (sw4728B_0079)
it's the strangest the weirdest thing in the world (sw4728B_0080)
blue head gasket (sw4728B_0081)
didn't do any damage to it (sw4728B_0083)
 i caught it real early (sw4728B_0084)
  ninety seven thousand (sw4728B_0087)
so it's not real early (sw4728B_0089)
yeah (sw4728B_0091)
never overheated (sw4728B_0092)
smell i smelled the  i smelled the coolant (sw4728B_0093)
went out and look (sw4728B_0095)
so it was coming from saw where it was coming from (sw4728B_0096)
right just shutting lifted off (sw4728B_0097)
and  (sw4728B_0100)
because i i have that (sw4728B_0101)
and then i have a a motorcycle which is actually usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining (sw4728B_0102)
that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle (sw4728B_0105)
it's  (sw4728B_0106)
and i (sw4728B_0107)
people who buy motorcycles of transportation i think are getting themselves (sw4728B_0108)
uh-huh (sw4728B_0115)
but i bet she really enjoys riding it (sw4728B_0116)
yeah (sw4728B_0119)
so you know (sw4728B_0120)
the last time you took i took your truck out just to just to go driving (sw4728B_0122)
yeah (sw4728B_0123)
i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just really enjoying it (sw4728B_0125)
but yeah (sw4728B_0129)
i mean the only thing i think i might get a new car or not necessarily new car but  another car (sw4728B_0130)
 i would consider it go into a a nine to a normal pick out rather than   covered pickup which one i got just 'cause there's a lotta times i wish i had a just an open dead to throw stuff (sw4728B_0131)
i'm sure i'm sure that that's very (sw4728B_0134)
i mean you got one (sw4728B_0135)
that's really convenient throw stuff in the back (sw4728B_0136)
yeah (sw4728B_0137)
right (sw4728B_0139)
have another way (sw4728B_0141)
right (sw4728B_0142)
i think they last a lot longer than anything else (sw4728B_0145)
yeah (sw4728B_0148)
yeah (sw4728B_0149)
 even though you know the the little job trucks are are good there too (sw4728B_0151)
but so (sw4728B_0152)
i think the chevy (sw4728B_0153)
i don't think the (sw4728B_0154)
i don't like the chevy as much as i like the forwards (sw4728B_0155)
i think they i think the forwards tend to last a little longer at least until recently (sw4728B_0157)
a friend of mine just bought or bought like a year ago (sw4728B_0162)
it's it's really an issue (sw4728B_0163)
i don't like dodgers at all (sw4728B_0164)
but one of the dodgers they have out now has a  the comments terrible diesel on it (sw4728B_0165)
 it's beautiful (sw4728B_0168)
nothing that lasts forever (sw4728B_0170)
 yeah (sw4728B_0172)
things (sw4728B_0173)
it's got a boat engineer (sw4728B_0174)
uh-huh (sw4728B_0178)
think about this (sw4733A_0001)
i do (sw4733A_0003)
so you see a big difference then in before and now do you (sw4733A_0008)
yeah (sw4733A_0009)
a lot of testing (sw4733A_0010)
uh-huh (sw4733A_0012)
i do too (sw4733A_0016)
 i think that was awful (sw4733A_0017)
i know (sw4733A_0021)
what's the new criteria  (sw4733A_0022)
we have all kinds of testing (sw4733A_0025)
and it's over and over (sw4733A_0026)
i._t. b s or and  just everything everything (sw4733A_0027)
and they test test test (sw4733A_0029)
i live in plano actually (sw4733A_0030)
i don't know if you've heard of plano (sw4733A_0031)
but it's a very transient community (sw4733A_0032)
a lot of people from everywhere (sw4733A_0034)
just north of dallas (sw4733A_0035)
and is grown and leaps and bounds (sw4733A_0037)
we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now (sw4733A_0038)
and most of them from other places (sw4733A_0040)
a j c penney's come down from new york and of course t i and xerox from rochester (sw4733A_0042)
and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in (sw4733A_0043)
and it's a very wealthy community (sw4733A_0045)
not that i am (sw4733A_0046)
but other people seem to be (sw4733A_0047)
and i would love to know why (sw4733A_0048)
but i mean they (sw4733A_0049)
they have (sw4733A_0050)
i would (sw4733A_0052)
really (sw4733A_0053)
i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes (sw4733A_0054)
they have everything (sw4733A_0055)
the kids are only wear name brand things into school (sw4733A_0056)
and it was one of these things (sw4733A_0057)
well it does (sw4733A_0060)
really does 'cause i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now (sw4733A_0061)
and  you know (sw4733A_0062)
do it to a point (sw4733A_0064)
but  not to where she feels different (sw4733A_0065)
but some of them are very rich (sw4733A_0067)
so  we just kind of have everything here (sw4733A_0069)
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents (sw4733A_0070)
and so i don't know how much of it as us and how much of it is texas (sw4733A_0072)
but the kids are expected to excel in everything (sw4733A_0073)
and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first (sw4733A_0075)
and they did to be (sw4733A_0076)
you know their parents expected (sw4733A_0078)
the teachers expected (sw4733A_0079)
texas once very badly to be considered tops and the school system (sw4733A_0080)
than if you read national surveys they're far from it (sw4733A_0082)
and so it's just a whole lot of testing in a whole lotta pushing to do well on these tests (sw4733A_0083)
well not very well (sw4733A_0086)
bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before test (sw4733A_0087)
i mean they make a big deal (sw4733A_0089)
to me the papers should just be put on the desk that day (sw4733A_0090)
and say just do this (sw4733A_0091)
you know i just feel that they do better that way (sw4733A_0092)
and (sw4733A_0095)
yeah (sw4733A_0096)
and and i have older children to that now are out of high school (sw4733A_0097)
and  they've always done this (sw4733A_0098)
i mean it's always been the same (sw4733A_0099)
but it is it's getting worse and worse (sw4733A_0100)
more pressure for everything (sw4733A_0101)
and i just think it's really odd (sw4733A_0102)
i i'm with you on that (sw4733A_0103)
you don't hear too many people say this (sw4733A_0104)
but i think it's a very long day (sw4733A_0105)
my feeling is that you know you're only a kid once and you don't want to spend your whole life in school (sw4733A_0107)
and i don't think that's right (sw4733A_0115)
i think we should do what europe does and include cultural activities and our school system (sw4733A_0116)
i don't think i should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano (sw4733A_0118)
i would like to see those things included in our school system because i think we should have well rounded kids not just book smart kids (sw4733A_0120)
and so i just find this a real problem (sw4733A_0124)
i think if they're going to be there all day they should find time (sw4733A_0125)
one of my daughters once was out of school was mano in her junior year i think it was (sw4733A_0126)
and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week (sw4733A_0127)
and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead (sw4733A_0128)
so what does that tell you (sw4733A_0129)
tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time (sw4733A_0131)
and they could be using this time better (sw4733A_0134)
uh-huh (sw4733A_0139)
that's a very long day for kindergarten (sw4733A_0141)
but i think that working parents have kind of demanded (sw4733A_0143)
you know because they don't they don't want to send him to daycare (sw4733A_0145)
that's why they want them there because somebody takes care of them all day (sw4733A_0147)
we have them at one school like (sw4733A_0149)
 do you have children in school (sw4733B_0002)
 i have two that are  now just about ready to graduate from college (sw4733B_0004)
they also have two that are just entering school (sw4733B_0006)
  well i think they're just pushing them much entirely too fast (sw4733B_0007)
 well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent to first grade (sw4733B_0011)
my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock (sw4733B_0013)
i think that's such a long day for a kindergarten (sw4733B_0015)
and  i have a preschooler (sw4733B_0018)
 i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was too immature for kindergarten (sw4733B_0019)
and i thought well how mature or do you have to be (sw4733B_0020)
and  there is (sw4733B_0023)
do you have the standardized testing now (sw4733B_0024)
yeah (sw4733B_0028)
no (sw4733B_0033)
yeah (sw4733B_0041)
yeah (sw4733B_0044)
you like to know what they're doing right (sw4733B_0051)
 man (sw4733B_0058)
well that makes it hard for you or doesn't it (sw4733B_0059)
yeah (sw4733B_0066)
it's hard to explain to them why you can't (sw4733B_0068)
right (sw4733B_0071)
 dear (sw4733B_0074)
right (sw4733B_0077)
right (sw4733B_0081)
and i was a kid (sw4733B_0084)
how are they coping with it (sw4733B_0085)
right (sw4733B_0088)
yeah (sw4733B_0093)
rather than anticipated (sw4733B_0094)
 it is (sw4733B_0106)
that's right (sw4733B_0108)
my son said that came home (sw4733B_0109)
he said he said mom i do is work (sw4733B_0110)
we hardly ever play (sw4733B_0113)
and (sw4733B_0114)
 like (sw4733B_0117)
right (sw4733B_0119)
wouldn't that be great (sw4733B_0121)
right (sw4733B_0123)
right (sw4733B_0130)
 my gosh (sw4733B_0132)
 my gosh (sw4733B_0133)
well for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunchtime (sw4733B_0135)
after lunch they have some  (sw4733B_0136)
trying to think if they have recess after lunch (sw4733B_0137)
and then they have an aunt or rest period (sw4733B_0138)
and  i think either send them home or do something a little more interesting (sw4733B_0140)
i agree (sw4733B_0142)
i wouldn't be surprised (sw4733B_0144)
i doubt if they would say that it was too long (sw4733B_0146)
 do you have the before school care at your school and the after school kids (sw4733B_0148)
capital punishment  i guess out in california is is had a lot of  yeah discourse in the paper (sw4736A_0001)
 apparently there's they haven't  executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven i believe (sw4736A_0002)
yeah (sw4736A_0006)
yeah (sw4736A_0007)
well we were we  we just started where we lived in redwood city when we were out there (sw4736A_0008)
and  and we found that  you know is a very liberal kind of community (sw4736A_0010)
but  i i really feel that that that the law enforcement community  you know puts these people behind bars (sw4736A_0011)
and then they they   you know  lawyers these lawyer groups get together (sw4736A_0012)
and they  they i think extend beyond the normal  appeal process  you know and just drag these this guy  his his  ultimate demise out for ten or fifteen years (sw4736A_0013)
and i i think that  that there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that (sw4736A_0014)
i think capital punishment   laws are probably stringent enough (sw4736A_0015)
but i think the appeal process as really getting in a way (sw4736A_0016)
do do you feel as though there should be  more  laws are are more  you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by  by   capital punishment (sw4736A_0018)
well the term technicality (sw4736A_0027)
some law enforcement community   you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which  agree just acts are done to  to you know get somebody into a situation where they're going to be guilty of of a crime (sw4736A_0028)
or whether  and and whether the rights of that individual ever been have been you know (sw4736A_0029)
 but  or whether there's just you know policemen has just made a   you know i'm a non non critical i hear a little bit not the right way to do it (sw4736A_0030)
but it but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a lawbreaker as being supportive (sw4736A_0031)
i'm at this juncture (sw4736A_0032)
you know i'm i'm not sure you know what constitutes a technicality (sw4736A_0033)
that that's what all these (sw4736A_0034)
and that's what all these court cases are (sw4736A_0035)
i mean our  our our glorious  you know mayor here in washington  six days away from getting out of out of the can (sw4736A_0036)
and  he he tried to appeal his conviction (sw4736A_0037)
 and you know it didn't work (sw4736A_0038)
but see that as a mayor everybody if you've got enough money will pumped appeal process dry (sw4736A_0039)
 in in the old days you know and say around that time of the battle of hastings you on that villages fewer transcripts or they they either you know drove you out in the woods (sw4736A_0040)
are you became award if somebody (sw4736A_0041)
you were his slaves (sw4736A_0042)
maybe in like what you did he kill you (sw4736A_0043)
and that has that pretty effective (sw4736A_0044)
 you know it's not good for civil rights i guess (sw4736A_0045)
but pretty effective and that you know you've got to get along in the community (sw4736A_0046)
and if you don't you will perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods (sw4736A_0047)
so i i mean as as a man has gotten more complicated so all of the  machinations to  you know protect him from from being  dumped on by a civilian authority and and in some in criminal accidents especially  murder cases and that sort of thing (sw4736A_0048)
 yeah (sw4736B_0003)
that's far back as i can remember (sw4736B_0004)
but before my time actually (sw4736B_0005)
well i think that currently it'll go away the laws stand isn't so much that the laws are unforeseeable or not (sw4736B_0019)
more if they're not enforcing the death penalty itself (sw4736B_0020)
that's the point where they were saying like you're you're going on death row (sw4736B_0021)
but they'll stay there for twenty years (sw4736B_0022)
and nothing's been done about it (sw4736B_0024)
 the laws exist and too many times are freaking limp and and  and appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little hole but they're defending attorney confined (sw4736B_0025)
and it's it's really getting a hundred many states (sw4736B_0026)
well it seems like well it seems as if in the past  typically they're in a a lot of cases of wrong upon us (sw4736B_0049)
and the whole the whole idea behind their current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't commit crimes albeit it seems that we are family in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty or getting off (sw4736B_0050)
 for instance  there was a case of fear is mac or  someone  someone who's being convicted for or was under a what was going to trial for murder was laid off because of a technicality that that off of the wrestling officer  did not read the defendant the rights (sw4736B_0051)
and where is all the evidence what's their the witnesses were there that everything was conclusively pointing to the individual yeah (sw4736B_0053)
a lot of companies now are are using  drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to the root out  the either  yeah elementary or intermediate or advanced drug users (sw4765A_0001)
and  i know that the government is  you know gives drug test yeah two all new entrance all new applicant applicants coming into government (sw4765A_0003)
and and i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it (sw4765A_0005)
hi i'm i guess i'm not a good civil libertarian (sw4765A_0006)
and i i feel as though  that  you know they if you you were a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background (sw4765A_0007)
of course we're (sw4765A_0008)
being involved in my organization  we we have deep background checks (sw4765A_0009)
yeah and so  but but sometimes you know drug use can can escape (sw4765A_0010)
and  i have absolutely no compunction about  using any and all means to to   workout figure out who has a drug program or her as a drug problem and  and putting that guy into into therapy or whatever it is to to where he will break this  activity (sw4765A_0013)
of course if he's falling in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stone or high is is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful and maybe there is no hope (sw4765A_0016)
what's your feeling (sw4765A_0018)
well i think of i draw the laws on the  first where like ninety nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that (sw4765A_0030)
yeah (sw4765A_0034)
well the thing of it is the the that that that that is   in many respects   you know just  i think an over simplification (sw4765A_0038)
i think that they there's so much criminal activity  that people go into the support drug habit (sw4765A_0040)
yeah (sw4765A_0043)
you know they they support drug habits with  with  you know things like  you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that (sw4765A_0044)
yeah (sw4765A_0045)
yeah i i must have meant that (sw4765A_0053)
yeah (sw4765A_0056)
yeah (sw4765A_0059)
i must admit that they the production cost of of these drugs are compared to that street market costs and the cost of society (sw4765A_0060)
yeah (sw4765A_0061)
i i i i think that that they you know the being in law enforcement you know they they i i probably have that kind of a drag county in felicity attitude toward (sw4765A_0065)
and but but they   i i really feel as though the introduction effort is is (sw4765A_0066)
soon as you you get rid of his one given that that's that's involved in drugs (sw4765A_0067)
yeah (sw4765A_0071)
and then another another one will jump up (sw4765A_0072)
but we we see (sw4765A_0074)
yeah (sw4765A_0077)
it it has it's as soon as we we wind up   you know (sw4765A_0078)
well we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand (sw4765A_0079)
that that people want to get get stone (sw4765A_0080)
and i i don't see that (sw4765A_0083)
yeah (sw4765A_0087)
uh-huh (sw4765B_0002)
uh-huh (sw4765B_0004)
sure (sw4765B_0011)
sure (sw4765B_0012)
yeah (sw4765B_0017)
 well i guess i i guess i'm probably a little more toward the other direction (sw4765B_0019)
 well i guess mainly because  it's  (sw4765B_0020)
there's two sides of it i guess (sw4765B_0021)
 one is that  if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drugs alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking and habits you know your ability to function then i i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot (sw4765B_0022)
 but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing your own private life your own private business (sw4765B_0023)
 and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that  things like drug laws seem to come and go (sw4765B_0024)
you know we had probation for a while (sw4765B_0025)
and we didn't have prohibition (sw4765B_0026)
 you know we've had i guess laws against  you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess (sw4765B_0027)
maybe a little longer (sw4765B_0029)
yea (sw4765B_0031)
some of the eighty eighty years or so (sw4765B_0032)
yeah (sw4765B_0033)
 so i (sw4765B_0035)
it's hard to i guess for me to justify what saint seems like you know basically a breech of the first time that you know freedom of from a search and seizure you know  on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or (sw4765B_0036)
who knows (sw4765B_0037)
probation certainly didn't last (sw4765B_0039)
well then you gotta look at prohibition (sw4765B_0041)
they had the same problems there right (sw4765B_0042)
 yeah (sw4765B_0046)
sure (sw4765B_0047)
it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition (sw4765B_0048)
i mean because it's illegal it costs more (sw4765B_0049)
it was legal (sw4765B_0050)
basic (sw4765B_0051)
you can buy pharmaceutical great cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an hour (sw4765B_0052)
clearly if you're into coke and now you want to do is you know what your brain that all day long it was legal you could do it real cheap (sw4765B_0054)
you know you'd be a minister nobody but yourself as long as you stay at home and (sw4765B_0055)
but yeah (sw4765B_0057)
get  (sw4765B_0058)
 yeah (sw4765B_0062)
you don't want to see what's (sw4765B_0063)
ridiculous amounts of money (sw4765B_0064)
 yeah (sw4765B_0068)
introductions hopeless (sw4765B_0069)
there's no way you're ever going to win that (sw4765B_0073)
tiny you squeeze the more the price goes up some more incentive there is (sw4765B_0075)
you have to lose invite (sw4765B_0076)
yeah (sw4765B_0081)
yeah (sw4765B_0082)
well (sw4765B_0084)
it goes back to what right what can society impose on people (sw4765B_0085)
making for somebody to be a good productive citizen (sw4765B_0086)
i don't think you can (sw4765B_0088)
i mean you know i knew was raised with that you know very strong bible work ethic (sw4765B_0089)
so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour day type people (sw4765B_0090)
so you know (sw4765B_0092)
i can really relate to (sw4765B_0093)
yeah (sw4765B_0094)
everybody out do their own share you know (sw4765B_0095)
i don't have any you know love law for people who are on the public dough just because they're too lazy to get a job or or that kind of stuff (sw4765B_0096)
but you know (sw4765B_0098)
yeah (sw4784A_0001)
i guess   it's an easy one for me (sw4784A_0002)
i think that  there's something seriously wrong (sw4784A_0003)
yeah (sw4784A_0004)
 i guess  i think they've lost accomplished (sw4784A_0006)
no i'm not sure they know exactly what the  public education is supposed to be for any more (sw4784A_0007)
but  i've voted with my feet (sw4784A_0008)
and  my kids go to parochial school (sw4784A_0009)
so  (sw4784A_0011)
one hundred percent of the  customers care (sw4784A_0013)
that's one thing (sw4784A_0014)
everybody cares about the education to kids are getting (sw4784A_0015)
and  they  take an active relatively active (sw4784A_0016)
which  i mean if you're sending two thousand dollars that way every year you  watch what goes on (sw4784A_0017)
  pay attention and participate (sw4784A_0018)
and you can influence the way things (sw4784A_0019)
yeah (sw4784A_0022)
immediately just isn't there (sw4784A_0023)
and   i also think that one of the problems (sw4784A_0025)
and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem (sw4784A_0026)
a problem with public education is really  really a problem with the culture (sw4784A_0027)
and i guess my evidence for that as the school districts in places like california for example where only a minority of the tax payers have children at school (sw4784A_0028)
and you can't get a tax levy passed (sw4784A_0029)
 people are  reluctant to pass a school tax levy even  when the money is needed it would be well spent because it's  if they don't have kids in schools (sw4784A_0030)
i think that's  a loss of civic virtue in a loss of   like cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids (sw4784A_0032)
i think that's  that's the principal problem is that  people no longer see it as a as their problem (sw4784A_0033)
as an immediate problem (sw4784A_0034)
yeah (sw4784A_0039)
yeah (sw4784A_0042)
i i believe that the original idea for public education states which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution  you know barely made it (sw4784A_0043)
i think it was added afterwards (sw4784A_0044)
i think the real the principal reason was  education for civic participation (sw4784A_0045)
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter (sw4784A_0047)
and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes (sw4784A_0048)
well that's exactly i was going to say (sw4784A_0052)
there seems to be really three reasons for education (sw4784A_0053)
one is education for civic duty (sw4784A_0054)
one is education for economic reasons (sw4784A_0055)
one is education for civilization (sw4784A_0056)
and i i think that one (sw4784A_0057)
that's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor (sw4784A_0061)
and i quit and got this abusive that notion (sw4784A_0062)
but  the   now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is  an economic enterprise to  trained people for jobs (sw4784A_0063)
and  and i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purposes (sw4784A_0064)
 i'm really sad to say this (sw4784A_0065)
i never thought i would have (sw4784A_0066)
but i really think that  the educational establishment has become part of the problem (sw4784A_0067)
no that's why i guess  sort of reluctant we are in favor of these  choice programs (sw4784A_0068)
that's (sw4784A_0076)
what is it that you are you know particularly upset (sw4784B_0005)
uh-huh (sw4784B_0010)
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial school that they wouldn't get in  the public school system (sw4784B_0012)
so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocket book for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of  real estate or other taxes (sw4784B_0020)
and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they like to see them happen (sw4784B_0021)
troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good (sw4784B_0036)
and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace i mean the idea that  you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes and in the at the local level are bigger votes at the national level (sw4784B_0037)
 it means that you got to be informed (sw4784B_0040)
you're going to have a certain level of education to do the reading in the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision (sw4784B_0041)
his taken on a more and you'd think we'd notice it economic threat (sw4784B_0050)
yeah (sw4784B_0051)
well i'm glad you added that one (sw4784B_0058)
i think that one significant (sw4784B_0060)
right (sw4784B_0069)
well i i agree with everything that you've said so far (sw4784B_0070)
and the only thing i'd want to add is that i'm a little more in contact i think the public school teachers then perhaps you are  except as a parent of your child (sw4784B_0071)
in the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing (sw4784B_0072)
and they are the three things that you mentioned (sw4784B_0073)
but they find that they're also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related (sw4784B_0074)
consumer (sw4784B_0077)
yeah  (sw4785A_0002)
well (sw4785A_0006)
and we had five (sw4785A_0008)
 yeah (sw4785A_0010)
and how about yourself (sw4785A_0011)
well (sw4785A_0014)
yeah (sw4785A_0017)
well when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that expensive (sw4785A_0018)
but i always had this made it a point that you know try to spend about ten minutes with each one of them (sw4785A_0019)
so it was an hour (sw4785A_0021)
but whether it was gone back and laying in bed with them and the shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories are reading too (sw4785A_0023)
six years (sw4785A_0025)
yeah (sw4785A_0027)
 yeah (sw4785A_0030)
look back and wonder how he did it (sw4785A_0031)
yeah (sw4785A_0033)
she never did (sw4785A_0034)
yeah (sw4785A_0038)
yeah (sw4785A_0039)
yeah (sw4785A_0043)
well that's plenty (sw4785A_0045)
yeah (sw4785A_0053)
right (sw4785A_0054)
well you know with kids you're not going to have a need house (sw4785A_0055)
and you know it it's tough to find time especially with both of them oregon (sw4785A_0057)
and you just have to set the time and say okay this is going to be it (sw4785A_0062)
right (sw4785A_0066)
right (sw4785A_0069)
 that's good (sw4785A_0074)
yeah (sw4785A_0075)
that's good that way too (sw4785A_0076)
yeah (sw4785A_0079)
well that's they said on all takes us about five ten minutes a day (sw4785A_0080)
you know and as the kids got older i made  you know helped me cut the grass and he kinda made that a project or whatever (sw4785A_0082)
yeah (sw4785A_0085)
 yeah (sw4785A_0087)
and  well yeah (sw4785A_0090)
and (sw4785A_0091)
yeah (sw4785A_0094)
just keep 'em (sw4785A_0095)
but  another thing we use it they were having family console uh-huh every sunday night (sw4785A_0098)
discussed everything that doesn't agree with him (sw4785A_0102)
we take turns being president (sw4785A_0103)
and every one of them get one (sw4785A_0105)
and i always thought we'd get out voted five to two (sw4785A_0106)
but i never worked that way (sw4785A_0108)
yeah (sw4785A_0110)
bring on we and we could bring up stuff too (sw4785A_0111)
and that was always a good time (sw4785A_0114)
but we really got than other kids well (sw4785A_0115)
 yeah (sw4785A_0118)
in fact that we're all in  over the weekend for easter (sw4785A_0119)
well we did too (sw4785A_0124)
and i remember the one daughter saying (sw4785A_0126)
we had a  a friend or is that you said drivers up a tree (sw4785A_0127)
and she said hey i don't make friends plenty of your friends (sw4785A_0129)
so why make fun of (sw4785A_0130)
kind of run kind of hit us between the eyes (sw4785A_0132)
hum (sw4785A_0136)
but that that was always good quality time for us (sw4785A_0137)
and then when i never had to attend (sw4785A_0140)
yes they missed that they had to abide by the rules (sw4785A_0141)
yeah (sw4785A_0143)
and boy that that show up (sw4785A_0144)
and we usually take notes (sw4785A_0146)
and you know the younger kids   maybe all of them needed to help at one time or another (sw4785A_0148)
and  but they were usually tougher on themselves and they were on us (sw4785A_0150)
and i loved it (sw4785A_0151)
yeah (sw4785A_0154)
yeah (sw4785A_0156)
yeah (sw4785A_0158)
but  but i feel for you and your husband (sw4785A_0159)
well yeah my my  two of my (sw4785A_0161)
kids (sw4785B_0001)
 you laugh (sw4785B_0003)
how many (sw4785B_0004)
what age (sw4785B_0005)
you've been through the fun part (sw4785B_0009)
i have a four and a half and a three (sw4785B_0012)
so it's (sw4785B_0015)
i i'm sure there's a lot of differences and the way in the way it's done now and then (sw4785B_0016)
yeah (sw4785B_0020)
yeah (sw4785B_0022)
what was the age difference between the oldest (sw4785B_0024)
so they were all real close (sw4785B_0026)
that's tough (sw4785B_0028)
that's a lot of time (sw4785B_0029)
did you both work your wife too (sw4785B_0032)
well qualified (sw4785B_0035)
she worked at home i'm sure (sw4785B_0037)
but that's (sw4785B_0040)
both my husband and i work (sw4785B_0041)
sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fit i have very little time each evening (sw4785B_0042)
maybe thirty minutes max (sw4785B_0044)
well he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking (sw4785B_0046)
and then i spend time with them well you know he's doing other stuff (sw4785B_0047)
and of course we try to spend a lotta time on the weekends (sw4785B_0048)
yeah there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it (sw4785B_0049)
but it's neat (sw4785B_0050)
and i live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know (sw4785B_0052)
well i'm except at that too (sw4785B_0056)
that's true (sw4785B_0058)
it is (sw4785B_0059)
yeah (sw4785B_0060)
that's true (sw4785B_0061)
well that's true (sw4785B_0063)
and and we do a lot of them on the weekends (sw4785B_0064)
we try to spend saturdays together (sw4785B_0065)
my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap time (sw4785B_0067)
things like that where they're not really missing the presents you know (sw4785B_0068)
and we do a lot of family things together (sw4785B_0070)
we're kind of go in the other direction this weekend (sw4785B_0071)
planning a trip just he and i (sw4785B_0072)
this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids and she was born four and a half years ago (sw4785B_0073)
well i decided that you know you need that once in a while that you need to play on the quality time (sw4785B_0077)
and i do think that if you plan it and spin that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day (sw4785B_0078)
yeah (sw4785B_0081)
sure (sw4785B_0083)
sure (sw4785B_0084)
and they think that's a family activity you know (sw4785B_0086)
yeah (sw4785B_0088)
that's great fun (sw4785B_0089)
my daughter's like mommy can i help you with the laundry (sw4785B_0092)
course you can (sw4785B_0093)
absolutely (sw4785B_0096)
yeah (sw4785B_0097)
uh-huh (sw4785B_0099)
what would you do (sw4785B_0100)
what (sw4785B_0101)
yeah (sw4785B_0107)
so they would just pick whatever issue kinda was it a head that we (sw4785B_0109)
and then (sw4785B_0112)
hi matt (sw4785B_0116)
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them (sw4785B_0117)
i (sw4785B_0120)
that's wonderful (sw4785B_0121)
see i was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobeyed me your mind to me (sw4785B_0122)
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it (sw4785B_0123)
yeah (sw4785B_0125)
uh-huh (sw4785B_0128)
wow (sw4785B_0131)
yeah (sw4785B_0133)
think of it that way (sw4785B_0135)
yeah (sw4785B_0138)
i like that idea (sw4785B_0139)
whatever was voted on  (sw4785B_0142)
well i think that's great (sw4785B_0145)
yeah (sw4785B_0147)
yeah (sw4785B_0149)
i think that's (sw4785B_0152)
i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment (sw4785B_0153)
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know (sw4785B_0155)
i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know (sw4785B_0157)
i've never been from california (sw4792A_0001)
pretty good (sw4792A_0005)
yeah (sw4792A_0008)
okay (sw4792A_0010)
i definitely think like decisions have to be anonymous (sw4792A_0012)
it's probably the safest thing (sw4792A_0016)
yeah (sw4792A_0019)
yeah (sw4792A_0021)
even like you know two thirds majority i mean (sw4792A_0022)
yeah (sw4792A_0027)
yeah (sw4792A_0030)
yeah (sw4792A_0034)
gives them a little too much power (sw4792A_0035)
plus you know you may be you know doing it you know a guilty verdict (sw4792A_0040)
but it may not be you know maybe for technical reasons (sw4792A_0041)
yeah (sw4792A_0044)
i know (sw4792A_0047)
yea (sw4792A_0050)
but (sw4792A_0051)
there'd be much more (sw4792A_0052)
i tend to follow it just to just to know what's going on (sw4792A_0057)
yeah (sw4792A_0063)
yeah (sw4792A_0064)
yeah (sw4792A_0065)
yeah (sw4792A_0068)
a little more about the civil cases when criminal cases which is (sw4792A_0071)
it's more in how you present it versus you know it was right (sw4792A_0073)
yeah (sw4792A_0076)
i know (sw4792A_0080)
i was a couple years ago involved and some pre trial stuff and (sw4792A_0082)
like you know we go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're going to (sw4792A_0084)
there's no say this this and this (sw4792A_0085)
yup (sw4792A_0088)
and it's like the the truth really isn't important anymore (sw4792A_0090)
yeah (sw4792A_0095)
it sounds like a little abusive our system (sw4792A_0100)
yeah (sw4792A_0103)
part of the more general (sw4792A_0104)
people don't want to take responsibility (sw4792A_0105)
you know it's (sw4792A_0107)
yeah (sw4792A_0109)
 yeah (sw4792A_0112)
originally chicago (sw4792A_0113)
i (sw4792A_0119)
uh-huh (sw4792A_0123)
yeah (sw4792A_0124)
yeah (sw4792A_0127)
i haven't either other than (sw4792A_0128)
yeah (sw4792A_0133)
i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better (sw4792A_0134)
yeah (sw4792A_0135)
i know (sw4792A_0141)
if it's criminal cases where you can't put them in jail because there's no room left (sw4792A_0144)
yeah (sw4792A_0149)
not at all (sw4792A_0154)
uh-huh (sw4792B_0002)
jim bless from minneapolis minnesota (sw4792B_0003)
how you doing (sw4792B_0004)
good (sw4792B_0006)
 i guess the topic is trial by a jury and how we should change that or or how we would change (sw4792B_0007)
 i'm writing whenever you are (sw4792B_0009)
so  what are your what are your thoughts on the subject (sw4792B_0011)
yeah (sw4792B_0013)
i think that's probably a good thing (sw4792B_0015)
yeah (sw4792B_0017)
i mean it's too easy to get a corum (sw4792B_0018)
and simple majority won't do (sw4792B_0020)
yeah (sw4792B_0023)
yeah (sw4792B_0025)
court rooms or to read it (sw4792B_0026)
and there's always that that chance at one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for good reason you know (sw4792B_0028)
so it's it's (sw4792B_0029)
definitely (sw4792B_0031)
 i don't know (sw4792B_0032)
i could i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing a sentence (sw4792B_0033)
yeah (sw4792B_0036)
yeah (sw4792B_0037)
i know of a couple of people at least two it'd be arguing with that are arguing against that pretty vehemently (sw4792B_0038)
but  (sw4792B_0039)
about the only good thing i would say about that is that what it that it would  her the process up (sw4792B_0043)
but i mean even now we've got i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that (sw4792B_0045)
that's what the trial by (sw4792B_0046)
i mean jeeze (sw4792B_0048)
if it if the judge was doing it themselves without any checks and balances who's to say (sw4792B_0049)
yeah (sw4792B_0053)
no doubt (sw4792B_0054)
are you involved in the legal system (sw4792B_0055)
yeah (sw4792B_0059)
i've got some friends that are lawyers (sw4792B_0061)
yeah (sw4792B_0062)
 just got his law degree (sw4792B_0066)
 tell you the truth i'm not real familiar with  the system insurance if you're a students the way it is right now (sw4792B_0067)
really haven't started it and  (sw4792B_0069)
yeah (sw4792B_0072)
sure (sw4792B_0074)
because a lot of those things it's all it's it's largely matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better (sw4792B_0075)
it's kinda weird (sw4792B_0077)
uh-huh (sw4792B_0078)
i always think about watching the people's court or something and how weird those cases (sw4792B_0079)
it's just (sw4792B_0081)
yeah (sw4792B_0083)
it's like boy this stuff that they can twist around is (sw4792B_0087)
it's pretty amazing (sw4792B_0089)
yeah (sw4792B_0092)
yeah (sw4792B_0093)
and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because (sw4792B_0094)
this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious (sw4792B_0096)
and he really gets into someone people (sw4792B_0097)
so he'll he'll food just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue its case (sw4792B_0098)
it's like it is it's it's a waste and people's time and the tax payers money and everything else (sw4792B_0099)
but  (sw4792B_0102)
yeah (sw4792B_0106)
yeah and and most of the time they look into place plane uh-huh  (sw4792B_0108)
you're from california (sw4792B_0110)
yeah (sw4792B_0111)
okay (sw4792B_0115)
it's just that (sw4792B_0116)
i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in minneapolis (sw4792B_0117)
from what i understand it's all pretty much the same except when you get to louisiana (sw4792B_0120)
in louisiana is completely different 'cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common (sw4792B_0121)
and the rest of the country's not or something like that (sw4792B_0122)
pretty strange (sw4792B_0125)
but  fortunately i never have had to go in even for jury duty (sw4792B_0126)
but  that friend of mine's  telling me that i might have to go in for  as a witness (sw4792B_0129)
so we'll see what happens (sw4792B_0131)
yeah (sw4792B_0132)
yeah (sw4792B_0136)
it's (sw4792B_0137)
there are too many big problems (sw4792B_0138)
there's there's such a court cases right now (sw4792B_0139)
you know to try to get them all in in a good time (sw4792B_0140)
and we already have too many lawyers as it is (sw4792B_0142)
yeah (sw4792B_0145)
that's true (sw4792B_0147)
and in fact there even letting some go (sw4792B_0148)
 i'm originally from florida (sw4792B_0150)
and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just 'cause they don't have room for  (sw4792B_0151)
that's not that's not a good solution either (sw4792B_0153)
not real sure what (sw4792B_0155)
randall  (sw4796A_0001)
do you have any special interest in space (sw4796A_0002)
uh-huh (sw4796A_0005)
yeah (sw4796A_0009)
what do you do now (sw4796A_0016)
too bad (sw4796A_0021)
 yeah i i i'm kind of young (sw4796A_0031)
i'm only twenty two (sw4796A_0032)
so   i'm not (sw4796A_0033)
there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as  you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to  go to another planet somewhat been thwarted in comparison to  the sixties (sw4796A_0034)
 although i have  (sw4796A_0036)
i kind of wonder  (sw4796A_0037)
if some if it were possible to market some form of  space technology you know to   to make an equitable it might really help the economy you know in the in the  respect that you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not (sw4796A_0038)
it'd be great if if we could find some way to to  use that to boost the economy (sw4796A_0040)
exactly (sw4796A_0046)
right (sw4796A_0054)
seems like  (sw4796A_0056)
so you're talking about positive side effects (sw4796A_0057)
okay (sw4796A_0060)
understand (sw4796A_0061)
sure (sw4796A_0064)
that makes a lot of sense (sw4796A_0065)
yeah (sw4796A_0068)
right (sw4796A_0080)
exactly (sw4796A_0084)
yeah (sw4796A_0088)
right (sw4796A_0090)
now we're done (sw4796A_0091)
yeah (sw4796A_0096)
i think you're right (sw4796A_0097)
i would too (sw4796A_0098)
hello (sw4796A_0099)
it's a that tried to  buy his way on to the space (sw4796A_0100)
 yeah (sw4796B_0003)
ever since i was a young and  used to watch the old  appalling missions going off in a classroom t v's (sw4796B_0004)
 i spent a lot of people   got  turned on by watching watching those go off (sw4796B_0006)
very exciting (sw4796B_0008)
yeah  (sw4796B_0010)
i've  i've always  wow wanted very much  to  be somehow involved and all that and  to  and to see see it actually happen (sw4796B_0011)
'course i really wanted to actually managed to get into space some day (sw4796B_0013)
 that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately (sw4796B_0015)
computer programmer (sw4796B_0017)
fortunately that can be done from the ground (sw4796B_0019)
yeah (sw4796B_0022)
made the wrong wrong career choice to get up in the states (sw4796B_0023)
the   (sw4796B_0024)
i used to think when i was when i was younger that  by this time we'd have lots more stuff in facing we do now (sw4796B_0025)
 frustrating at times (sw4796B_0028)
i don't know what you think about all that (sw4796B_0030)
yeah (sw4796B_0039)
yeah (sw4796B_0041)
well the   (sw4796B_0042)
i've always felt that   one of the long term solution is to at least a few of our problems would be to have  some sort of a solar power satellites up (sw4796B_0043)
 because that's a  you know instantly renewable resource it doesn't do it that doesn't require   any particularly  nasty environmental impact (sw4796B_0045)
and you can just get as much power as you need up there (sw4796B_0047)
and it's a matter of how big you build a (sw4796B_0049)
and of course the side effects of this is you have to have a lunar minding basis and space stations and easy transport into space and also the other thing is i think we should be doing (sw4796B_0051)
so the side effects of doing that which i think it would be good you know very very good for for everyone in the long run is  is it some of the other things i'd like to see happened what happened also (sw4796B_0052)
yeah (sw4796B_0058)
right (sw4796B_0062)
the only problem is of course that  that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there (sw4796B_0066)
they want to do the research (sw4796B_0069)
and  they're all you know (sw4796B_0070)
do any commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about  ones for flash value like  the trip to mars which is would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth (sw4796B_0072)
but the same money could probably be far better spent on   litter bases and solar power satellite research and you know and so forth (sw4796B_0075)
it would be it would be being done for the  glitz and show factor to get politicians votes instead of instead of fur (sw4796B_0077)
we should eventually send some of the people to mars but not just because it's a glitzy to do so (sw4796B_0079)
we should do it because for the for the return we get for it (sw4796B_0081)
and   unfortunately that's not why things happen (sw4796B_0083)
i would settle for for the the side effects for useful like they (sw4796B_0086)
but  (sw4796B_0087)
the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say what we did it (sw4796B_0089)
now now we're done (sw4796B_0092)
do this anymore to play around with the space stuff anymore (sw4796B_0093)
that's what happened with apollo (sw4796B_0094)
 but  i'd give almost anything to get in space (sw4796B_0095)
what do you think about capital punishment (sw4801A_0001)
yeah (sw4801A_0003)
which crimes do you feel that (sw4801A_0004)
yeah (sw4801A_0006)
because (sw4801A_0007)
so many times that so brutal and just a recurrent (sw4801A_0008)
salaries i think should also (sw4801A_0010)
yeah (sw4801A_0013)
uh-huh (sw4801A_0016)
yeah (sw4801A_0019)
go ahead (sw4801A_0022)
texas is too (sw4801A_0023)
texas i saw on t v the other night is the has had forty six and like the past several years (sw4801A_0024)
so they're pretty hip on it too i guess (sw4801A_0026)
they do it by lethal injections and huntsville (sw4801A_0027)
yeah (sw4801A_0031)
yeah (sw4801A_0034)
yeah (sw4801A_0038)
yeah (sw4801A_0042)
that's what's happening here (sw4801A_0046)
there's (sw4801A_0047)
like  (sw4801A_0048)
in fact  big good when i was is she is the the turnover rate so   repeat offender anything let out and doing it again (sw4801A_0049)
yeah (sw4801A_0056)
i was just if they were going to do it they would be a little more consistent and dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't (sw4801A_0058)
be a little more you know (sw4801A_0060)
not being able to put it off for fifteen years (sw4801A_0061)
 really (sw4801A_0071)
and  (sw4801A_0073)
yeah (sw4801A_0076)
yeah (sw4801A_0080)
yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little a little too lenient (sw4801A_0084)
 kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty (sw4801A_0086)
i'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas (sw4801A_0089)
yeah (sw4801A_0097)
what do you do (sw4801A_0098)
 really (sw4801A_0100)
 really (sw4801A_0103)
uh-huh (sw4801A_0105)
yeah (sw4801A_0112)
i just (sw4801A_0113)
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in california (sw4801A_0114)
i think (sw4801A_0116)
forty six in the last twenty five years i think is what (sw4801A_0117)
they gave him ran down to texas texas tends to be a little more robust and discipline area (sw4801A_0119)
yeah (sw4801A_0124)
and they they don't get repealed as easily as they do (sw4801A_0126)
like the guy in california you got so you know twice before he went to the gas chamber (sw4801A_0128)
and then they said okay now (sw4801A_0129)
you don't have to (sw4801A_0130)
and i took him back (sw4801A_0131)
i mean it just seems yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent (sw4801A_0132)
and then you had like (sw4801A_0135)
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know (sw4801A_0136)
no (sw4801A_0145)
i don't think (sw4801A_0146)
 the military doesn't execute anymore (sw4801A_0147)
yeah (sw4801A_0148)
 that's before the phone squad or whatever (sw4801A_0150)
so i think that the only one is  right (sw4801A_0152)
well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes (sw4801B_0002)
well i think first degree murder  probably warranted (sw4801B_0005)
right (sw4801B_0009)
exactly (sw4801B_0011)
current crimes like the serial rapist or serial murderer or whatever (sw4801B_0012)
i come from a state that has  i'm originally come from the state that has  the death penalty (sw4801B_0014)
i'm from florida (sw4801B_0015)
and  they're pretty liberal on it (sw4801B_0017)
they tend to like five people left and right which (sw4801B_0018)
go ahead (sw4801B_0021)
yeah (sw4801B_0025)
yeah (sw4801B_0028)
okay (sw4801B_0029)
i think florida still uses electric chair (sw4801B_0030)
 i don't i don't know (sw4801B_0032)
some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing god (sw4801B_0033)
and that's not (sw4801B_0035)
i don't think that's right (sw4801B_0036)
but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it (sw4801B_0037)
i think crime rate's deterred a little bit by using it (sw4801B_0039)
and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not (sw4801B_0040)
florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let 'em out every year (sw4801B_0043)
they (sw4801B_0044)
sure (sw4801B_0051)
and it's like no that's a big problem (sw4801B_0052)
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build (sw4801B_0053)
and it's really you know it's it gets to be a big problem (sw4801B_0055)
 go ahead (sw4801B_0057)
right (sw4801B_0059)
yeah (sw4801B_0063)
because a lot of these guys you know they get in (sw4801B_0064)
they they get off for good behavior (sw4801B_0065)
and i don't know (sw4801B_0066)
up in minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty (sw4801B_0067)
and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know because they figure well you know sure i i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something (sw4801B_0068)
 but then (sw4801B_0069)
if i if i listed good behavior i'm out and maybe five or ten (sw4801B_0070)
 sure (sw4801B_0072)
just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jail  you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early (sw4801B_0074)
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head  (sw4801B_0077)
i don't know (sw4801B_0078)
i think that may and solve a lot of that (sw4801B_0079)
maybe not solve it (sw4801B_0081)
but i don't know (sw4801B_0082)
maybe (sw4801B_0083)
yeah (sw4801B_0085)
what do you do georgia (sw4801B_0088)
 okay (sw4801B_0090)
right (sw4801B_0091)
programming (sw4801B_0092)
okay (sw4801B_0094)
fantastic (sw4801B_0095)
i'm a doctoral student at university of central florida (sw4801B_0099)
yeah (sw4801B_0101)
i'm doing an internship at honeywell (sw4801B_0102)
yeah (sw4801B_0104)
but  i don't know (sw4801B_0106)
it's an interesting issue (sw4801B_0107)
like you say in texas there's been quite a few (sw4801B_0108)
and then florida in the last few years i think there's been a lot (sw4801B_0109)
i can't i can't give you figures (sw4801B_0110)
but  (sw4801B_0111)
uh-huh (sw4801B_0115)
 is that right (sw4801B_0118)
okay (sw4801B_0120)
yeah (sw4801B_0121)
i can not yeah i've heard things about that (sw4801B_0122)
for the they don't mess around very much (sw4801B_0123)
yeah (sw4801B_0125)
jeeze (sw4801B_0133)
that's a lot of repels (sw4801B_0134)
yeah (sw4801B_0138)
i don't know (sw4801B_0139)
 i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it (sw4801B_0140)
 i guess (sw4801B_0141)
what is it puts a policy now with trees and (sw4801B_0142)
do they  do they actually for trees (sw4801B_0143)
in a life sentence (sw4801B_0144)
yeah (sw4801B_0149)
yeah (sw4801B_0151)
so how do you feel about it (sw4812A_0001)
yeah (sw4812A_0003)
i myself almost  i'm in favor of it (sw4812A_0004)
 i work at hunting (sw4812A_0005)
and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i was brought up (sw4812A_0006)
i think that's pretty standard (sw4812A_0008)
at least at honey well it is (sw4812A_0009)
 i think it's important to ensure the quality and and  i don't know almost the goodness of character and that kind of thing (sw4812A_0010)
you work (sw4812A_0012)
 okay (sw4812A_0014)
 okay (sw4812A_0015)
 great (sw4812A_0018)
yeah (sw4812A_0026)
and that that definitely happens you know (sw4812A_0027)
i mean those the drug test your other accurate (sw4812A_0028)
but there's always that margin a mirror (sw4812A_0029)
and that's that's something to be aware of (sw4812A_0031)
another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate (sw4812A_0032)
they aren't that sensitive (sw4812A_0033)
like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they going to do about that (sw4812A_0034)
i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell (sw4812A_0036)
and   you know i know they didn't catch that (sw4812A_0037)
they would have said something (sw4812A_0038)
 i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types (sw4812A_0039)
although the literature they give what he says yeah we do this (sw4812A_0040)
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for (sw4812A_0041)
i don't know (sw4812A_0043)
what program u n over at carnegie mellon (sw4812A_0044)
 okay (sw4812A_0046)
right (sw4812A_0047)
yeah (sw4812A_0048)
i'm a graduate student at u c f in florida university of central florida (sw4812A_0049)
and this is actually an internship up here (sw4812A_0051)
but  they  even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing (sw4812A_0052)
yeah (sw4812A_0053)
right (sw4812A_0055)
 they essentially (sw4812A_0057)
yeah (sw4812A_0058)
yeah (sw4812A_0059)
centrally  they essentially  maybe the offer and then and then  do the drug testing thing after that (sw4812A_0060)
so  it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests (sw4812A_0061)
and then they essentially give you the offer (sw4812A_0062)
and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that (sw4812A_0064)
so  there's some noise on this (sw4812A_0066)
i'm actually in a mall calling (sw4812A_0067)
yeah (sw4812A_0068)
he probably wondering (sw4812A_0070)
yeah (sw4812A_0075)
that's a good question (sw4812A_0076)
i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave  if you fail i believe they give you one more chance (sw4812A_0077)
they probably give me a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it (sw4812A_0078)
but  you know once again those things are not that accurate (sw4812A_0080)
so there's undoubtedly proportion of people who do fail (sw4812A_0081)
but  (sw4812A_0082)
are you working right now (sw4812A_0083)
yeah (sw4812A_0084)
okay (sw4812A_0088)
right (sw4812A_0089)
yeah (sw4812A_0090)
that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screen you know this was going to honeywell (sw4812A_0091)
a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there (sw4812A_0092)
and he's doing an internship with i b m (sw4812A_0094)
and  they basically  did the same exact thing (sw4812A_0096)
 we both got our internships at the same time (sw4812A_0097)
and we both had to go through drug trusting of the same time (sw4812A_0098)
so one of those things where we went through our kind of an identical process (sw4812A_0099)
but  (sw4812A_0100)
yeah (sw4812A_0102)
that's one thing they don't do as a drug testing while you're on the job (sw4812A_0104)
i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it (sw4812A_0106)
but they don't (sw4812A_0107)
you know so that's good i guess (sw4812A_0109)
i don't know (sw4812A_0110)
i mean i  i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time (sw4812A_0111)
well i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there  you know smoking a joint or whatever (sw4812A_0112)
and  you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know (sw4812A_0114)
but no (sw4812A_0115)
they don't they don't really do that (sw4812A_0116)
yeah (sw4812A_0120)
 i i don't see any problem with with testing for random drugs (sw4812B_0002)
yeah (sw4812B_0011)
 well i'm a graduate student right now at carnegie mellon (sw4812B_0013)
and i i just came from saint paul  interviewing the three  (sw4812B_0016)
and  they have a policy for  testing (sw4812B_0019)
if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start (sw4812B_0020)
and i guess the only drawback i can see too to drug testing is in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some sort of false positive result then there could be some sort of a problem (sw4812B_0022)
but  (sw4812B_0025)
yeah (sw4812B_0030)
yeah (sw4812B_0035)
right (sw4812B_0042)
electrical engineering (sw4812B_0045)
 wow (sw4812B_0050)
they test you  before they before you start or before you even interview (sw4812B_0054)
uh-huh (sw4812B_0063)
yeah (sw4812B_0072)
what happens if you were to fail (sw4812B_0073)
and do they give you like one one more chance or two more chance (sw4812B_0074)
 no (sw4812B_0085)
i'm just about to finished my masters in may and  just interviewing with companies right now (sw4812B_0087)
do they test you right now at work too (sw4812B_0101)
okay (sw4812B_0105)
wow (sw4812B_0118)
is it formal policy that they said that they might test (sw4812B_0119)
okay (sw4826A_0001)
i'm here (sw4826A_0002)
how do you feel about the public schools (sw4826A_0003)
uh-huh (sw4826A_0005)
yeah (sw4826A_0008)
right (sw4826A_0011)
well that's interesting (sw4826A_0015)
i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw george (sw4826A_0016)
and  she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there (sw4826A_0018)
and she complained quite a bit about the school system there (sw4826A_0019)
and (sw4826A_0021)
right (sw4826A_0023)
right (sw4826A_0025)
and (sw4826A_0026)
i can't really say much about the schools up here (sw4826A_0027)
really don't come from here (sw4826A_0028)
i'm only up here temporarily on an internship (sw4826A_0030)
but  i live in orlando florida usually (sw4826A_0031)
and the schools down there from what i know are not bad (sw4826A_0033)
they're pretty good (sw4826A_0034)
but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas or not that good (sw4826A_0036)
for example i have a brother in north carolina (sw4826A_0038)
and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad  just terrible (sw4826A_0039)
wow (sw4826A_0044)
it's slow (sw4826A_0047)
what do you think's wrong to cause (sw4826A_0056)
yeah (sw4826A_0059)
yeah (sw4826A_0064)
uh-huh (sw4826A_0065)
yeah (sw4826A_0067)
yeah (sw4826A_0069)
yeah (sw4826A_0070)
that's that's one thing i worry about (sw4826A_0071)
there you go (sw4826A_0073)
uh-huh (sw4826A_0074)
yeah (sw4826A_0077)
probably quite a few black people up there (sw4826A_0078)
and (sw4826A_0079)
 is that right (sw4826A_0083)
 okay (sw4826A_0087)
yeah (sw4826A_0091)
but you know it's (sw4826A_0092)
you don't want a scene racist or prejudiced or whatever (sw4826A_0093)
but then again (sw4826A_0094)
there is no denying that (sw4826A_0097)
sure (sw4826A_0098)
teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school (sw4826A_0099)
that's right (sw4826A_0102)
you can't do that (sw4826A_0103)
right (sw4826A_0105)
see i grew up in nebraska (sw4826A_0106)
and the school that i went to there was fantastic (sw4826A_0108)
yeah (sw4826A_0109)
i i really consider myself very very lucky (sw4826A_0110)
 we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to go to a class (sw4826A_0111)
but (sw4826A_0113)
yeah (sw4826A_0115)
we used up right along you know (sw4826A_0116)
i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily (sw4826A_0117)
but you're right you know (sw4826A_0123)
with all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taking something away from the discipline i think (sw4826A_0124)
yeah (sw4826A_0127)
right (sw4826A_0129)
i was going to ask you if they were that was an option (sw4826A_0130)
well our public schools are are really poor i feel (sw4826B_0004)
 i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation (sw4826B_0006)
 we're toward the bottom (sw4826B_0007)
and  there's a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong that you would think it'd be easy to correct (sw4826B_0009)
the system doesn't allow corrections (sw4826B_0012)
how 'bout you (sw4826B_0014)
yes (sw4826B_0017)
yes (sw4826B_0020)
cobb county it's better than the county and (sw4826B_0022)
she was in (sw4826B_0024)
uh-huh (sw4826B_0029)
okay (sw4826B_0032)
that's great (sw4826B_0035)
well i feel that we're way by hand (sw4826B_0040)
 i have a son that it's in the fourth grade (sw4826B_0041)
and  they have just nah taken up division (sw4826B_0043)
yeah (sw4826B_0045)
yeah (sw4826B_0046)
yeah (sw4826B_0048)
my husband and i go to the store (sw4826B_0050)
we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication division thing (sw4826B_0051)
and i feel like  there are several areas that were just really really slow in (sw4826B_0052)
and  i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system (sw4826B_0054)
well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system (sw4826B_0057)
the money they do have they're not but i do not use like wow (sw4826B_0058)
 she my son's teacher has twenty seven students (sw4826B_0060)
and that certainly is a lot of students for one person and deal with on an everyday basis (sw4826B_0062)
but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children (sw4826B_0066)
when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the cat class in an uproar and you are not at liberty to do something about it other than give 'em on campus  send them to the principal's office and eight and you know it can it can really be bad (sw4826B_0068)
 i also i think we have a lot of  hispanics (sw4826B_0072)
and we have a lot of  (sw4826B_0075)
the county i'm i'm in  the minorities are mostly hispanics (sw4826B_0076)
now (sw4826B_0080)
from the county i worked in the county they marched (sw4826B_0081)
yes (sw4826B_0084)
and what (sw4826B_0085)
and there's very very few blacks (sw4826B_0086)
so what so that's  (sw4826B_0088)
i i hate to say (sw4826B_0089)
it's not a problem  because i hate to feel like they are problem although they are (sw4826B_0090)
it is a problem i'd stay slim inner schools and (sw4826B_0095)
and you can't put all the children in special education (sw4826B_0101)
yeah and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in what the homework is done you know (sw4826B_0104)
yeah (sw4826B_0112)
you're a teacher had control (sw4826B_0114)
i believe i was too (sw4826B_0120)
uh-huh (sw4826B_0125)
 well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school (sw4826B_0126)
we'd just can not afford it (sw4826B_0128)
 it's (sw4826B_0131)
go first (sw4830A_0001)
okay (sw4830A_0004)
 one of the things they talked about was  did we what do what do we think about a judge you making that decision (sw4830A_0005)
and i really don't agree with that (sw4830A_0007)
i think that the trial by jury is better  you know than having to unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible (sw4830A_0008)
i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time (sw4830A_0009)
you know what i mean (sw4830A_0011)
yeah (sw4830A_0014)
right (sw4830A_0017)
that's it (sw4830A_0019)
well i i feel the other thing too (sw4830A_0022)
they were saying  you know what new ways could you could you you know change the system (sw4830A_0023)
i really think that  we spend a lot of time  going through appeal after appeal after appeal after (sw4830A_0024)
and if  if you go to a trial by jewelry and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's no question (sw4830A_0025)
it's beyond a reasonable doubt (sw4830A_0027)
all these things (sw4830A_0028)
you know was going to the over and over again (sw4830A_0029)
and it can go on for ten twenty years (sw4830A_0032)
i i think this is a little ridiculous (sw4830A_0034)
i think the only people who benefit from that about the lawyers (sw4830A_0036)
i'm serious (sw4830A_0039)
and i think that the lawyers have costs a lot of the problems that that exists in this in the criminal system today with (sw4830A_0040)
you know if someone is (sw4830A_0042)
well (sw4830A_0044)
well i know (sw4830A_0047)
that's what i'm saying (sw4830A_0048)
but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in that regard (sw4830A_0049)
i mean you know people who commit a crime to stay (sw4830A_0050)
i don't know how it works exactly (sw4830A_0051)
you know they get less  sentences (sw4830A_0052)
and i understand that the jails a full of people you know  and that they have to do something (sw4830A_0054)
but i think that the reason they awful is because they know that they can get away with it (sw4830A_0056)
you you know what i'm saying (sw4830A_0058)
we don't have  well a lot of states don't have capital punishment (sw4830A_0059)
and  i i think they should (sw4830A_0061)
and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like i say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people (sw4830A_0063)
and  you know (sw4830A_0064)
they they caught dead to rights (sw4830A_0066)
i just think that that's they've they've taken a life (sw4830A_0067)
and if they should pay for with their life (sw4830A_0068)
yeah (sw4830A_0071)
uh-huh (sw4830A_0074)
 really (sw4830A_0076)
it's (sw4830A_0079)
yeah (sw4830A_0080)
no  (sw4830A_0083)
uh-huh (sw4830A_0084)
i don't know (sw4830A_0085)
 what would you do to change it to make it better (sw4830A_0086)
yeah (sw4830A_0092)
i don't agree with that at all (sw4830A_0093)
imagine the guilt that person would have (sw4830A_0095)
it burned out (sw4830A_0096)
there's no possible way that you could  you know feel good about yourself (sw4830A_0098)
you had to do something like that day after day (sw4830A_0101)
no (sw4830A_0103)
 really (sw4830A_0104)
well well do you think people should have a trial if they're caught that to rights (sw4830A_0106)
i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you (sw4830A_0110)
in other words you're saying you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances or (sw4830A_0112)
yeah (sw4830A_0116)
yeah (sw4830A_0118)
well i i (sw4830A_0120)
and (sw4830B_0002)
you can start (sw4830B_0003)
right (sw4830B_0010)
right (sw4830B_0012)
there isn't there this topic is kind of mood (sw4830B_0013)
there's there's no way (sw4830B_0015)
we couldn't survive in in a jury system in a trial system without a jury (sw4830B_0016)
 one man can never be one men one woman can never be objectionable in every case (sw4830B_0018)
 every person has their opinion (sw4830B_0020)
and that's why jury selection is often very difficult  (sw4830B_0021)
right (sw4830B_0026)
right (sw4830B_0030)
they shouldn't allow an appeal (sw4830B_0031)
yeah (sw4830B_0033)
no that's right (sw4830B_0037)
worked for a law firm (sw4830B_0038)
right (sw4830B_0041)
well plea bargain it's a different story (sw4830B_0043)
plea bargain something completely different (sw4830B_0045)
that that actually prevent trials or at least speeds them up (sw4830B_0046)
right (sw4830B_0053)
right (sw4830B_0055)
right (sw4830B_0060)
and we do (sw4830B_0062)
right (sw4830B_0065)
right (sw4830B_0069)
and you're saying as far as the appeal  procedure is concerned (sw4830B_0070)
we just had the case (sw4830B_0072)
i'm sure you've probably heard of marion barry (sw4830B_0073)
 his his last appeal was with denied two days before his sentence there was up (sw4830B_0075)
so i mean his appeal within (sw4830B_0077)
two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession (sw4830B_0078)
but  that was absurd (sw4830B_0081)
there was no there was no reason the appeal pass the sort of dragged on that long for six months sentence (sw4830B_0082)
well  they only (sw4830B_0087)
i i was i you know (sw4830B_0088)
the appeal of procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of (sw4830B_0089)
 like i said as far as removing the jury and having the judge sense that's absurd (sw4830B_0090)
there's no way that could work (sw4830B_0091)
 but (sw4830B_0094)
exactly (sw4830B_0097)
exactly (sw4830B_0099)
right (sw4830B_0100)
no one wants to talk (sw4830B_0102)
 and you know like i said you know everyone has their opinions about every case (sw4830B_0105)
 yeah (sw4830B_0107)
i i feel that everyone is everyone is  entitled to a trial a jury (sw4830B_0108)
that that that right (sw4830B_0109)
well i mean where their witnesses (sw4830B_0111)
right (sw4830B_0113)
right (sw4830B_0114)
that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case (sw4830B_0115)
i mean you can have fifty people in an audience watching a murder takes place (sw4830B_0117)
and you'd you'd still they're still mitigating circumstances (sw4830B_0119)
and he went when you were the big company or a big organization a lotta times  you know the benefits are good (sw4831A_0001)
and you know the (sw4831A_0002)
 you know sometimes you don't get tuned into what's going on (sw4831A_0003)
i think the biggest benefiting or the biggest benefit other than wages that  that anybody can get in a in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on (sw4831A_0004)
and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to do (sw4831A_0005)
what's your feeling about benefits (sw4831A_0006)
sort of benefits or did you like to get from a big town (sw4831A_0007)
yeah (sw4831A_0026)
right well i worked for the government (sw4831A_0027)
and  actually i work for the f b i (sw4831A_0028)
and  and so you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason (sw4831A_0030)
but  but basically  there's lots of things that that we should know about projects (sw4831A_0031)
i'm an engineer yeah (sw4831A_0032)
i'm a coat (sw4831A_0034)
sometimes (sw4831A_0035)
i worked in the same lab with a guy (sw4831A_0036)
and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years (sw4831A_0037)
and we should have (sw4831A_0038)
we're we're now collaborate (sw4831A_0039)
and it (sw4831A_0041)
for two years we did and way which was kind of stupid (sw4831A_0043)
but  but  our organization is doing something else on monday (sw4831A_0044)
 we're having  for all on classify programs where we're having a little tables put out in front of me in a lab and the hallways (sw4831A_0045)
every all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought it was kind of interesting and but  but that sort of sort of thing (sw4831A_0046)
but it but i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on (sw4831A_0049)
and and but of course most most of the time management has a hard time distributing are getting the word out to the people who must know (sw4831A_0051)
and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months (sw4831A_0052)
or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if you're management doesn't think that (sw4831A_0053)
but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing (sw4831A_0054)
in the private sector i would think at one of the major  situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties wow is keeping a job until you retire (sw4831A_0055)
and engineers are  our baggage to most   as they get older to most companies (sw4831A_0058)
and  it's very much like the military (sw4831A_0059)
when i was out (sw4831A_0060)
you know you you think well boy am getting more money (sw4831A_0061)
and i'm getting more responsibility (sw4831A_0062)
i'm doing this (sw4831A_0063)
but they should climb up that tree pretty soon you're them the branches get smaller on the top of the tree (sw4831A_0064)
pretty soon somebody falls off (sw4831A_0066)
i've fallen off twice in the private sector (sw4831A_0067)
and  and you know i can get (sw4831A_0069)
yeah (sw4831A_0079)
yeah (sw4831A_0087)
maybe retired (sw4831A_0088)
well since i'm kind of on the the older side you know i i i just feel like when i start talking about benefits i talk about i'm concerned about medical benefits (sw4831B_0008)
 my  my husband works for mcdonald douglas (sw4831B_0009)
and so and his benefits medical benefits assault excellent (sw4831B_0010)
that's really great (sw4831B_0011)
you know i work for  with a bank western financial (sw4831B_0013)
and  they don't let me know really about anything that's going on (sw4831B_0015)
even some of the immediate things that i need to know i don't know until the next (sw4831B_0016)
all of a sudden we know we got changes made (sw4831B_0017)
changing departments (sw4831B_0018)
we're changing policy (sw4831B_0019)
changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing (sw4831B_0020)
and i feel like if i i don't necessarily need to be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level (sw4831B_0021)
you are right there (sw4831B_0022)
you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as  as a company is concerned (sw4831B_0023)
but i i do kinda like to know what's going on and what's happening (sw4831B_0024)
and i think i could be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little more information along that line (sw4831B_0025)
 my gosh (sw4831B_0029)
yeah (sw4831B_0042)
yeah (sw4831B_0047)
that is interesting (sw4831B_0048)
exactly (sw4831B_0050)
right (sw4831B_0057)
it seems to be kinda kinda scary you know 'cause you think of (sw4831B_0071)
see my son's eighteen right now (sw4831B_0072)
he he's  he wants to go into engineering (sw4831B_0073)
and the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into it now it's kind of open (sw4831B_0074)
and he's interested in basically three different areas (sw4831B_0075)
but  it's difficult for me to try to give them any kind of advice or to advise them or anything like that (sw4831B_0076)
he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen another thirty years (sw4831B_0077)
and  in seven years it becomes pretty critical (sw4831B_0080)
i mean my  brother in law is like  i mean he's sixty (sw4831B_0081)
he's not ready to retire (sw4831B_0082)
but his company is is is  is a closing up (sw4831B_0083)
and because of the defence cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut backs (sw4831B_0085)
and he's not ready to be (sw4831B_0086)
i guess i guess by what you said you're you're you don't feel your  privacy has been invade invaded anytime recently (sw4834A_0001)
right (sw4834A_0008)
right (sw4834A_0010)
i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means (sw4834A_0011)
 you know i would (sw4834A_0012)
there's a lotta times though  you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or what not (sw4834A_0013)
and you know next thing you know  someone calls and wants to sell you this or that (sw4834A_0014)
and it's real hard to to tell him you know that you're not interested (sw4834A_0015)
you do tell them you're not interested (sw4834A_0016)
and they still keep asking you you know and and keep badgering you about it (sw4834A_0017)
that aggravates me (sw4834A_0018)
but i don't know that you could call that invading of invading my privacy (sw4834A_0019)
because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say well you know i want my name and lifted or what man you know (sw4834A_0020)
does it (sw4834A_0022)
uh-huh (sw4834A_0035)
very (sw4834A_0047)
let me ask you about this (sw4834A_0048)
here's something that does been kind of concerning me lately (sw4834A_0049)
my fiance received a bill from   lord and taylor company (sw4834A_0050)
you know they're  they're a department store (sw4834A_0051)
she received a bill from them  that she had visited some (sw4834A_0053)
and i think it was there in florida (sw4834A_0054)
maybe it was in miami (sw4834A_0055)
 that she had visited a store there (sw4834A_0056)
and  they had this bill  that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise  over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise (sw4834A_0057)
and the date that that she supposedly made this purchased she was in denver with me for thanksgiving (sw4834A_0059)
 and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number (sw4834A_0061)
 and and i've i've heard recently that   this is a common occurrence where people are using (sw4834A_0063)
they they use joe blow so  social security number  and can  potentially ruin someone's credit (sw4834A_0064)
yeah (sw4834A_0072)
yeah (sw4834A_0077)
yeah (sw4834A_0080)
we got it cleared up eventually (sw4834A_0084)
what happened (sw4834A_0085)
nope (sw4834B_0002)
really (sw4834B_0003)
 the only thing that annoys me is when  people call and they  you have patient calls (sw4834B_0004)
thing that bothers me (sw4834B_0006)
that's about rowing invading my privacy (sw4834B_0007)
 do you feel that you're (sw4834B_0009)
but that doesn't work (sw4834B_0021)
 no (sw4834B_0023)
'cause a lotta times they die all (sw4834B_0024)
they get your name from  or any type of contest or anything (sw4834B_0025)
 yeah steak and the local department store for shopping spree or something (sw4834B_0027)
your phone number on there (sw4834B_0028)
they pass your phone number on to another company (sw4834B_0029)
 or you  (sw4834B_0031)
or or like the news papers they just dial random layers and stuff (sw4834B_0032)
they even call the newspapers hair even call people who are already subscribe (sw4834B_0033)
and  why was describing to a paper i get so upset at the (sw4834B_0034)
you called me one more time of get stopped subscribing (sw4834B_0036)
and the the local local papers real nice she just yeah ask them to remove your number from there was (sw4834B_0037)
and  (sw4834B_0038)
call up their regular during regular hours (sw4834B_0039)
they're  they have a special department (sw4834B_0040)
they'll take your numbers that their lives (sw4834B_0041)
but the  orlando paper  yeah they refused to take it off the list (sw4834B_0043)
they call every month (sw4834B_0044)
when you have more than one phone number yeah calling each number you have (sw4834B_0046)
uh-huh (sw4834B_0065)
you know a person's social security number and their mailing address it and their mother's maiden name  you can basically become that  purse (sw4834B_0066)
 if the purchase was made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped (sw4834B_0068)
since it was and shipped her address she could prove yeah that wasn't her (sw4834B_0070)
 if it was you know coming into the store and stuff then she would have whoever made the purchase whatever has find some kind of  you know documents (sw4834B_0071)
and  (sw4834B_0073)
the signature  (sw4834B_0074)
they should be able to provide you copy would that thing (sw4834B_0075)
and if they can't provided signature yeah they have to charge (sw4834B_0076)
if the person has yeah there's her social security number i'd be real concern that they  that she's not a black was on  it's (sw4834B_0079)
 'cause she won't be able to cash checks because most places verified through there (sw4834B_0081)
she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything with that well i have (sw4834B_0082)
i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't (sw4858A_0001)
and  i guess  looking back on i tend to think it was pretty  mostly in the states (sw4858A_0002)
and the other hand  the more i learn about the history the more i see it with incremental  decisions any one of which were sort of understandable at the time (sw4858A_0004)
and  but on the whole i think  probably was the wrong thing to do (sw4858A_0006)
how about you (sw4858A_0007)
yeah (sw4858A_0012)
yeah (sw4858A_0014)
yeah (sw4858A_0017)
yeah (sw4858A_0027)
yeah (sw4858A_0031)
it's funny (sw4858A_0032)
tonight i was  helping my kid with an essay on  stalin (sw4858A_0033)
and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how in in world war two the personalities of style and hitler and churchill more or less define the war (sw4858A_0035)
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was  it was almost a personal struggle among these three (sw4858A_0036)
 i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense (sw4858A_0037)
 there are certainly all leaders (sw4858A_0039)
and  and  with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them (sw4858A_0040)
i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the  early decisions in the vietnam war that the  people saw the cold war as  you had to draw a line and and defend it (sw4858A_0042)
otherwise there'd be  they get to someplace else (sw4858A_0043)
looking back it seems like that was only partly true that  they might have been a better place to draw the line (sw4858A_0045)
 i guess you can i guess you can say that  a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight  brought the cold war to an end (sw4858A_0046)
but i don't think you can just find anywhere it just just in order to  called the bully out and beat him (sw4858A_0047)
and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war (sw4858A_0048)
i felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward (sw4858A_0049)
and  we were wrong (sw4858A_0050)
but  (sw4858A_0052)
like as i said the more i hear about it the more i can see each decision that was made us being understandable (sw4858A_0053)
but the cumulative effect with to really get into a a hopeless situation (sw4858A_0054)
and as you say  going halfway was probably worse than  committing  committing to it completely and  winning it whatever that would (sw4858A_0055)
yeah (sw4858A_0059)
yeah (sw4858A_0062)
yeah (sw4858A_0065)
you're not (sw4858A_0067)
is that building (sw4858A_0071)
yeah (sw4858A_0072)
what about the domestic effect (sw4858A_0077)
like i was thinking that maybe the most important effected had was to make it  possible and even popular too  criticize the government (sw4858A_0078)
yeah (sw4858A_0079)
pendulum started the swing  maybe even too far to the point where   supporting and government decision and foreign policy was sort of optional from the vietnam war (sw4858A_0080)
and that tradition is still (sw4858A_0083)
i mean it's dying (sw4858A_0084)
but it's still alive as opposed to (sw4858A_0085)
desert storm stuff may have  killed it (sw4858A_0086)
i think that was one of the big that you know the  the domestic unrest (sw4858A_0088)
uh-huh (sw4858B_0003)
well i'm a i i was just  in high school i guess when it when it end (sw4858B_0008)
end up being (sw4858B_0010)
i was in the last last a lottery (sw4858B_0011)
glad it was over by then (sw4858B_0013)
i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there (sw4858B_0015)
just because you know we didn't really do anything and we went over us (sw4858B_0016)
you know  (sw4858B_0018)
those people that i know (sw4858B_0019)
i work with several that were over there (sw4858B_0020)
for some of them it was just kind of i don't i'm not so much a holiday (sw4858B_0021)
i guess that's how they tend to talk about it (sw4858B_0022)
that that they just kind of lived out in the woods (sw4858B_0023)
and every now and then they'd gone shit they're rifles (sw4858B_0024)
and then they'd come back (sw4858B_0025)
and (sw4858B_0026)
that they weren't really allowed to do anything (sw4858B_0028)
yeah (sw4858B_0029)
to me it seems like we only went halfway if even half way (sw4858B_0030)
yeah (sw4858B_0041)
yeah (sw4858B_0056)
i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't we weren't prepared for (sw4858B_0057)
i guess the best sort of the atrocities of war (sw4858B_0058)
 i mean the other wars seemed like a value on war (sw4858B_0060)
i mean they you know they seemed like a value (sw4858B_0061)
you knew you know who is good (sw4858B_0063)
 who was bad (sw4858B_0064)
and it was  it was a traditional the traditional battle of kinda good versus evil you know whichever way it is (sw4858B_0066)
but in in in the vietnam war it seems like it was (sw4858B_0068)
the sides and the lines that were drawn or all confused as to who's good and who's (sw4858B_0069)
 and  (sw4858B_0070)
even it seems like even the people (sw4858B_0073)
 south vietnamese and north vietnamese and of course the lay offs (sw4858B_0074)
and the supposed to be involved (sw4858B_0075)
yeah (sw4858B_0076)
yeah (sw4858B_0081)
yeah (sw4858B_0082)
yeah (sw4858B_0087)
okay (sw4859A_0001)
 generally i get  you know most of my news in the weekly magazines like time newsweek and and  u s news and world report with with occasional smattering of of  you know the wall street journal and of course a local paper (sw4859A_0002)
but  my my only complaint is i really don't have enough time to to look at the articles every day and and go through a paper you know exhausted details (sw4859A_0004)
so that's why i concentrate on a weekly magazine (sw4859A_0005)
well yes (sw4859A_0007)
i well i i don't think i have the time to really become a student in every article (sw4859A_0008)
and and so i i like the weekly magazines  because it gives me the you know the high points of what's going on (sw4859A_0010)
 but many times  you know the the local a local news kinda suffers (sw4859A_0012)
but here i am you know our with our nation's capital (sw4859A_0013)
yeah (sw4859A_0014)
yeah (sw4859A_0018)
yes (sw4859A_0019)
exactly (sw4859A_0020)
well when they when they capital gang always talk about the people inside the ballet i'm saying to myself hey guys i'm inside the ballet (sw4859A_0021)
but  it turns out that  that the the c n n is i think is great (sw4859A_0022)
for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events (sw4859A_0023)
but generally they're they're they're more you know kinda thing (sw4859A_0025)
and i don't really  you know i don't really feel as though i've gotten a sufficient  you know dose of news that way (sw4859A_0026)
yes (sw4859A_0031)
 the and the and the chronicle are the only things that are really can stand up there (sw4859A_0040)
redwood city (sw4859A_0044)
used to work tax (sw4859A_0045)
places like that (sw4859A_0050)
yeah (sw4859A_0053)
yes (sw4859A_0062)
i've i i enjoy (sw4859A_0063)
see they have a we have both cspan is here (sw4859A_0064)
but but really the on public t v and you make near all there is one is an hour's program that i always (sw4859A_0065)
if i watch any news program and it will be mcneil air and and occasionally cspan (sw4859A_0068)
i like i i saw the  the  the tapes that were that were run up marion barry drug busts (sw4859A_0070)
you know the whole thing was was run on that (sw4859A_0071)
and and and and also they have the  the   parliament's question answer period (sw4859A_0072)
when when it first  you know when it first tuned in on that i you know (sw4859A_0079)
this one this (sw4859A_0080)
i think it was somebody was just curious like just just ripping the hell out of some another person (sw4859A_0081)
and i (sw4859A_0082)
and everybody was you know making noise in the background (sw4859A_0083)
here's this dude in a wig (sw4859A_0087)
and i said to myself it's another monty python that i didn't know about (sw4859A_0090)
and then and then up jumps margaret thatcher offered green bay (sw4859A_0091)
and i said  it's part of them and (sw4859A_0092)
yeah (sw4859A_0094)
so i i thought the i can't wait (sw4859A_0095)
going over to the britain in the mid mid may (sw4859A_0096)
i i'm going to  you know  approach my  (sw4859A_0097)
this is how i discovered you know the quite the prime minister scam question answer period you know (sw4859A_0098)
yeah (sw4859A_0103)
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like (sw4859B_0006)
 that's right (sw4859B_0015)
very close actually (sw4859B_0016)
it's almost a a bedroom community for the capital (sw4859B_0017)
yeah (sw4859B_0027)
a lot of my information comes from several source (sw4859B_0028)
probably pretty high up and lift as national public radio  which i like (sw4859B_0029)
 i i think it's fairly objective (sw4859B_0032)
and i always liked the letters that they read which tend to accused him of being too liberal and too conservative (sw4859B_0033)
and while there's an inherent  filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read  i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of  they were in the other side (sw4859B_0034)
that's that's potential indication of balance (sw4859B_0035)
and generally i really do believe they are pretty balanced (sw4859B_0036)
 i also read time magazine (sw4859B_0037)
we get one of the daily news papers  round here where we go through various sections of the various  the articles in the front section (sw4859B_0038)
uh-huh (sw4859B_0039)
 you (sw4859B_0042)
did you just deliver under (sw4859B_0043)
 okay (sw4859B_0046)
 yeah (sw4859B_0047)
okay (sw4859B_0048)
i know exactly where that is (sw4859B_0049)
we we get the mercury which i generally don't because actually pretty good newspaper (sw4859B_0052)
yeah (sw4859B_0054)
the newspaper i've really been impressed with when i read it at times (sw4859B_0055)
well as the los angeles times which i found to be a very good quality  newspaper (sw4859B_0056)
like a lot of the articles (sw4859B_0058)
the other thing when you said (sw4859B_0059)
we don't have cable t v (sw4859B_0060)
so but the other thing that you refer to that always sounds really interested in me as as a cult cspan (sw4859B_0061)
yeah (sw4859B_0066)
i never saw them (sw4859B_0073)
that would have been in (sw4859B_0074)
yeah (sw4859B_0076)
i think that's always fascinated (sw4859B_0077)
i wish we had something (sw4859B_0078)
it's usually the prime minister (sw4859B_0086)
that's  (sw4859B_0088)
major (sw4859B_0089)
which could be another very python (sw4859B_0093)
i i have seen that (sw4859B_0100)
 aside from the level of with which is much higher than generally an american politics  which i really enjoy i really liked the fact that they have a chance to have card real questions i think (sw4859B_0101)
it's on like the fairly control  press conferences the presidents of the united states have here where they they always (sw4859B_0102)
getting activity in our household i is is  kind of an informal kind of situation (sw4868A_0001)
you know but (sw4868A_0002)
actually what happens is  his my check it's automatically deposited (sw4868A_0003)
i don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore (sw4868A_0004)
it just gets deposits (sw4868A_0005)
and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those bills that come in (sw4868A_0006)
and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them you say (sw4868A_0007)
and so our our budget (sw4868A_0008)
we really don't have a form of budgeting situation (sw4868A_0009)
every time i've ever tried one it's  i've just got wrapped up in my new show (sw4868A_0010)
and  i've just decided not to pursue it (sw4868A_0011)
put your budget situation (sw4868A_0012)
well they actually that kind of a situation is just a wonderful for budgets (sw4868A_0019)
well like you know my my parents too (sw4868A_0035)
you you were born in the in the late thirties early (sw4868A_0036)
yeah (sw4868A_0041)
well that's that's good (sw4868A_0050)
well we we buy (sw4868A_0054)
where we just got through buying a twenty five for a refrigerator a new ceramic top stove and new dishwasher (sw4868A_0055)
and and we put twenty eight hundred dollars on a church along with my trip to japan which was was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars (sw4868A_0057)
and you know (sw4868A_0059)
right (sw4868A_0061)
i mean we just we got a monster you know bill coming (sw4868A_0062)
but but we also have zero interest being paid (sw4868A_0063)
and we pay it off as as it goes (sw4868A_0064)
so we never really get that much over over extended (sw4868A_0068)
yeah (sw4868A_0073)
we're doing (sw4868A_0074)
we have you know  (sw4868A_0075)
this is our our our big  (sw4868A_0076)
we did redecorating (sw4868A_0077)
too you know two new pieces and everything and the family room and new carpet (sw4868A_0078)
i mean we've just  we've just been spending spending spending (sw4868A_0079)
but but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've we've had two kids in college that i just graduated in the past year (sw4868A_0083)
so were you know we don't have (sw4868A_0085)
yeah (sw4868A_0087)
it's  it's about time that we did that (sw4868A_0088)
but yeah the the terrible part about it i looked at it (sw4868A_0089)
 which still pretty good to me (sw4868A_0090)
why we need to replace it (sw4868A_0091)
but but unfortunately my my my wife leave feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate  thing to to (sw4868A_0092)
i mean at rutgers thirteen years old (sw4868A_0093)
why not replace it (sw4868A_0094)
i say might go for another thirteen (sw4868A_0095)
but  (sw4868A_0096)
never find that  (sw4868A_0097)
i i don't spend that much money (sw4868A_0103)
i just  we just sort of have had  you know too many obligations to you (sw4868A_0104)
sort of take care of the kids when they were in school (sw4868A_0105)
they they got through school (sw4868A_0106)
that was the major you know decade of expenses (sw4868A_0107)
so we we feel is (sw4868A_0108)
but as far as any form of budgeting  you know i i would just apparently have been very fortunate (sw4868A_0109)
we went to want to go out to eat we go out to eat (sw4868A_0110)
i never really you know have to program money for that or make choices yeah (sw4868A_0111)
but  we don't have that upper  a lifestyle (sw4868A_0112)
after all (sw4868A_0113)
well actually  i've i've had a couple of different situations (sw4868B_0013)
my current one has been the most successful (sw4868B_0014)
 at a certain point in life (sw4868B_0015)
and my husband my ex husband was an alcoholic (sw4868B_0016)
and we got divorced back in the mid seventies (sw4868B_0017)
and that left me with three teenagers (sw4868B_0018)
certainly (sw4868B_0020)
but at any rate what happened was that i i just absolutely put away all the credit card (sw4868B_0021)
i didn't (sw4868B_0022)
send them back (sw4868B_0023)
nothing (sw4868B_0024)
just put them away (sw4868B_0025)
because there was one that it was really handy to have (sw4868B_0026)
if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it (sw4868B_0027)
 mostly we just spent cash whatever we had (sw4868B_0029)
we didn't have it we absolutely didn't spend (sw4868B_0030)
and as things improve (sw4868B_0031)
once once i got them all through college  came to the point where  (sw4868B_0032)
my parents came through the depression (sw4868B_0033)
not sure how old you are (sw4868B_0034)
uh-huh (sw4868B_0037)
and  my mother hardly ever spend anything on herself or on the house (sw4868B_0042)
and that's kinda the way i was raised (sw4868B_0043)
so i'm not a very demanding person in in that aspect (sw4868B_0044)
so for quite a period of time i just let didn't spend any money (sw4868B_0045)
now meanwhile like i had to a building make belts (sw4868B_0047)
hi intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy right center there  and not ever have to spend any money on interest (sw4868B_0048)
and that's that's the way i've operated ever since then (sw4868B_0051)
and you know if if something goes on sale i don't have the money i still don't buy it (sw4868B_0053)
right (sw4868B_0056)
 my (sw4868B_0058)
 my (sw4868B_0060)
uh-huh (sw4868B_0065)
and that's the way i do my credit cards (sw4868B_0066)
almost all my purchasing on credit cards (sw4868B_0070)
it's the fact that i have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them unfold (sw4868B_0072)
 my (sw4868B_0080)
envious (sw4868B_0081)
but (sw4868B_0082)
uh-huh (sw4868B_0084)
time for you to do these things and (sw4868B_0086)
well that's so funny (sw4868B_0098)
that is wonderful (sw4868B_0099)
you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money you need somebody to help you spend (sw4868B_0100)
i mean certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should there  (sw4868B_0102)
okay (sw4877A_0001)
 so you're yeah i guess so you're probably in the same  same situation  we're in (sw4877A_0002)
we're kind of past having to provide childcare (sw4877A_0003)
our kids are grown up (sw4877A_0004)
my grandchildren yet (sw4877A_0005)
that   (sw4877A_0006)
 one's twenty six (sw4877A_0009)
and the other is  twenty twenty one (sw4877A_0010)
so they're  they're they're getting (sw4877A_0012)
no no no prospects right away for anything to happen (sw4877A_0014)
but  (sw4877A_0018)
 okay (sw4877A_0030)
yeah (sw4877A_0041)
yeah (sw4877A_0049)
that's hard (sw4877A_0050)
yeah (sw4877A_0051)
yeah (sw4877A_0064)
yeah (sw4877A_0072)
what did you do when your kids were growing up (sw4877A_0073)
for you (sw4877A_0074)
i'd say (sw4877A_0091)
yeah (sw4877A_0092)
right (sw4877A_0094)
well (sw4877A_0095)
uh-huh (sw4877A_0114)
yeah (sw4877A_0115)
right (sw4877A_0137)
a little more flexibility (sw4877A_0143)
can come and go (sw4877A_0144)
yeah (sw4877A_0147)
what our kids were small we had a couple of  good good women who  would often to  get him to come to the house (sw4877A_0148)
how old are your children (sw4877B_0008)
uh-huh (sw4877B_0011)
they're going to get in there (sw4877B_0013)
yeah (sw4877B_0015)
uh-huh (sw4877B_0016)
 i see (sw4877B_0017)
i have five children (sw4877B_0019)
i have an eighteen year old son (sw4877B_0020)
and my girls are like twenty three twenty six twenty eight and twenty nine (sw4877B_0021)
i have three granddaughters right now (sw4877B_0023)
and  i  (sw4877B_0025)
one's in iowa (sw4877B_0026)
and  she's she's a teacher (sw4877B_0028)
and what she does she teaches at a preschool (sw4877B_0029)
and so she kind of (sw4877B_0031)
and they let her bring her for a little daughter in for free (sw4877B_0032)
and then so (sw4877B_0034)
but she just works part time (sw4877B_0035)
and i have another daughter in  bountiful utah (sw4877B_0037)
and she has to work fulltime (sw4877B_0038)
and it's just carrying her but (sw4877B_0039)
she has a private babysitter (sw4877B_0040)
and  the baby just screen (sw4877B_0042)
the babies like seventeen months (sw4877B_0043)
and she just screen (sw4877B_0044)
even she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there (sw4877B_0046)
they're not even there yet you know (sw4877B_0047)
and then i have my own  i have a seven months old granddaughter (sw4877B_0052)
and  her mother stays home (sw4877B_0053)
they live they live with us you know in orange county is really expensive (sw4877B_0054)
live with us (sw4877B_0057)
and so of course we love it 'cause we get to see this cute little baby all the time (sw4877B_0058)
but   she just (sw4877B_0059)
 she used to work in in the preschool and and and childcare (sw4877B_0060)
she said after working in there (sw4877B_0061)
and you know her she was a provider (sw4877B_0062)
there's only so much one person can do (sw4877B_0063)
it's so awful (sw4877B_0065)
she said she'll never put her child in a in a in a pre in preschool (sw4877B_0066)
i'm sure there must be some good ones around there somewhere (sw4877B_0068)
but it's really it's really really very difficult (sw4877B_0070)
well when (sw4877B_0075)
the first  ten years see first ten or twelve years i stayed home (sw4877B_0076)
and  and then after that i i went to work (sw4877B_0078)
and    a couple of times i just   you know (sw4877B_0080)
then i had one (sw4877B_0081)
and then that job ran up because it's kind of a government seater type job (sw4877B_0082)
and then like about the later i i tried to get the baby to a babysitter (sw4877B_0083)
supposed to be a good  recommended person from the church (sw4877B_0084)
newer personally (sw4877B_0085)
she has two kids are grown and everything (sw4877B_0086)
i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child (sw4877B_0087)
i mean first of all  you know her children were sick all the time (sw4877B_0089)
for my son stayed over there he got sick (sw4877B_0090)
same thing same thing i heard kids had (sw4877B_0093)
so  we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock (sw4877B_0096)
and he she'd take my son and her daughter over to kindergarten (sw4877B_0097)
they  i was saying that he's he's sick (sw4877B_0099)
because he has the same thing that all my kids (sw4877B_0100)
that's what he got (sw4877B_0101)
well okay (sw4877B_0102)
it's not like he's going to affect her kids (sw4877B_0103)
but then what happened was as i said that he just threw up (sw4877B_0104)
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty (sw4877B_0105)
so she said well she will keep them home (sw4877B_0106)
he'll probably to sleep anyway (sw4877B_0107)
well you know (sw4877B_0108)
woman sent her send him to kindergarten (sw4877B_0109)
kindergarten (sw4877B_0110)
soon as they went there the teacher took one look at him (sw4877B_0111)
and he threw up again (sw4877B_0112)
and they put him in the nursery they put him in the nurses office (sw4877B_0113)
and then what happened was is you know they gave her call because i knew that she was my baby sitter (sw4877B_0116)
called her (sw4877B_0117)
and they said  that he (sw4877B_0118)
she wasn't home (sw4877B_0119)
her older kids are sick (sw4877B_0121)
but she wasn't home (sw4877B_0122)
and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick (sw4877B_0123)
what did he what did she keep him home (sw4877B_0124)
she didn't do that (sw4877B_0126)
so you go to the point where he is he's supposed to get out of a kindergarten like about two thirty (sw4877B_0127)
and i had to leave work (sw4877B_0128)
was it was five o'clock in the evening (sw4877B_0129)
i found out he was still there at school (sw4877B_0130)
and they were calling (sw4877B_0131)
if somebody's got to pick him up (sw4877B_0132)
and i kept thinking that she was going to get picked up she was going to pick 'em up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school (sw4877B_0133)
trying to get my husband to come and pick 'em up and all that kind of stuff (sw4877B_0134)
and he had a hundred and four fever (sw4877B_0135)
they couldn't give 'em anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything (sw4877B_0136)
so serious (sw4877B_0138)
i put that (sw4877B_0139)
and i stayed home for a while  (sw4877B_0140)
then i went and got a  a job in real estate work and kind of just my time a little bit better (sw4877B_0141)
yeah (sw4877B_0145)
 i haven't had any good really very good experience which  (sw4877B_0146)
well  (sw4880A_0003)
i'm employed by a company that does do random drug testing (sw4880A_0004)
and i've got very definite  opinions about it  yeah which i haven't changed all that much from my first reaction soon from when they when they announced it but  developed a little more i guess but i haven't changed (sw4880A_0005)
what about you (sw4880A_0006)
are you are in involved at all (sw4880A_0007)
yeah (sw4880A_0013)
yeah (sw4880A_0017)
yeah (sw4880A_0023)
yeah (sw4880A_0025)
yeah (sw4880A_0026)
 that's that's my (sw4880A_0027)
i go (sw4880A_0029)
to me no matter how much the  our company claims that it's not a constitutional issue that because this is  between  a company in an employee is not it's not a government (sw4880A_0030)
the constitution doesn't apply (sw4880A_0032)
but it it seems to me that it still should (sw4880A_0033)
our companies doing it because they're a  government contractor (sw4880A_0034)
 and so it's it's required for certain some form some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts (sw4880A_0035)
uh-huh (sw4880A_0036)
yes (sw4880A_0038)
okay (sw4880A_0039)
and our company is taking that and gone all the way (sw4880A_0040)
yeah (sw4880A_0041)
okay (sw4880A_0042)
first off we don't we don't have enough courage to  pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage  'cause that would offend them  if they if they weren't (sw4880A_0043)
so we'll just accused everybody of using drugs and make it all even (sw4880A_0044)
 and and  (sw4880A_0045)
then  (sw4880A_0048)
but and they (sw4880A_0049)
so it's complete random testing (sw4880A_0050)
well it's random in the sense that you don't know if when (sw4880A_0051)
it is not random in the sense that they have said within three years everyone in the company will be tests (sw4880A_0052)
 and  you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day (sw4880A_0054)
that  certainly has no life threatening  capabilities  right you know in in my job (sw4880A_0055)
and  yes (sw4880A_0058)
i agree that there are there are  jobs that are definitely life threatening (sw4880A_0059)
and and there needs to be a line drawn somewhere reasonable improper (sw4880A_0060)
you know (sw4880A_0061)
right (sw4880A_0069)
yeah (sw4880A_0071)
right that that i that i will give credit that  our company for and that that i think there's there's a couple of levels of test in terms of of  some drugs (sw4880A_0072)
and essentially the first thing is  is on the order of dumb clip newspaper in the in the urine and and or something (sw4880A_0073)
it's not quite that someone (sw4880A_0074)
but it's fairly simple (sw4880A_0075)
kind of test (sw4880A_0077)
and then there's a a much more   refined tested  spectrometer fearful whatever it's called someone chromatography  to determine exactly what the what the things (sw4880A_0078)
and  (sw4880A_0081)
i've been with this company for for sixteen years now (sw4880A_0085)
and  (sw4880A_0088)
no (sw4880A_0089)
and it and it and it has it has (sw4880A_0090)
they did that three or four years before they did with everybody (sw4880A_0091)
and i  at that time i can justify it in terms of someone new coming in you don't you don't know (sw4880A_0092)
but on the other hand  someone new coming in the nose or going to have a test (sw4880A_0093)
okay (sw4880B_0001)
well  i'll let you start i guess (sw4880B_0002)
 no (sw4880B_0008)
i mean i'm (sw4880B_0009)
florida's not do that  although  i had an ex employer that (sw4880B_0010)
 the previous job i used to have  (sw4880B_0011)
after  i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass the drug test (sw4880B_0012)
 i i don't know (sw4880B_0014)
my feeling is that  certain jobs that whereas there's  immediate threat to life and limb  if should somebody be under the influence of drugs i'd be willing to support that (sw4880B_0015)
for example   well   train engineers (sw4880B_0016)
cause  you know  like there was a it was  several years ago or an amtrak engineer (sw4880B_0018)
crash and killed from people 'cause he was  smoking marijuana (sw4880B_0020)
i guess air traffic controllers i wouldn't want them to be for hugs and airplane pilots (sw4880B_0021)
but where it's not necessary  in that regard where there's not an immediate threat to life and lay on our property  i i i would seriously question (sw4880B_0022)
uh-huh (sw4880B_0024)
so it's the government mandating it to a certain extent (sw4880B_0037)
yeah (sw4880B_0046)
well (sw4880B_0047)
right (sw4880B_0056)
yeah (sw4880B_0062)
yeah (sw4880B_0063)
i agree (sw4880B_0064)
i mean it's well there's also the issue of  (sw4880B_0065)
here i remember hearing a year or so ago that  a lot of (sw4880B_0066)
it was a higher rate and the analysis of drug results (sw4880B_0067)
or i shouldn't say hi (sw4880B_0068)
several percent (sw4880B_0070)
kind of a course kind of tests (sw4880B_0076)
is that done (sw4880B_0079)
right (sw4880B_0080)
let me ask you this (sw4880B_0082)
at the time you hired over this company  was that prior to (sw4880B_0083)
okay (sw4880B_0086)
so that this is obviously not a condition of employment that you suggested to this (sw4880B_0087)
are you in the middle of anything (sw4886A_0001)
the whole thing (sw4886A_0008)
the framing an (sw4886A_0012)
nice to get together because when i had my last big project i had the contract to do the framing (sw4886A_0018)
and i did all sheet rocking and the interior (sw4886A_0019)
yeah (sw4886A_0027)
my wife wishes i hadn't done that (sw4886A_0030)
i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easier (sw4886A_0037)
yeah (sw4886A_0041)
you  on on your friend in new square footage (sw4886A_0048)
that stuff that was already  (sw4886A_0049)
yeah (sw4886A_0051)
the back yard and turn it into a part of the house and you knew you knew how to do this (sw4886A_0055)
do you build on slabs down there (sw4886A_0069)
to build it up off the ground (sw4886A_0070)
and  (sw4886A_0072)
had those poor (sw4886A_0076)
dinner so (sw4886A_0078)
just put forms on the ground and fill in the country (sw4886A_0083)
the last thing i did completely myself with an outside deck which has pretty proud of (sw4886A_0088)
yeah (sw4886A_0097)
designed it from scratch (sw4886A_0098)
pretty good job (sw4886A_0099)
those are nice (sw4886A_0101)
pretty forgiving (sw4886A_0102)
you can always tear stuff out and read (sw4886A_0103)
yeah (sw4886A_0104)
right (sw4886A_0109)
yeah (sw4886A_0116)
i built that two levels and with the big toy box and some benches and   back rest and all that stuff (sw4886A_0117)
yeah (sw4886A_0124)
had a friend with a tractor who dug the peer holes (sw4886A_0125)
so we can pour concrete and supportive if   nice from four by four posts (sw4886A_0127)
and  and then the rest of it i just (sw4886A_0128)
 a contractor friend helped me  with some of the  foundation work (sw4886A_0130)
but  (sw4886A_0131)
it was about four or five hundred square feet (sw4886A_0132)
the same size as the addition that i just put on (sw4886A_0133)
yeah (sw4886A_0134)
yeah (sw4886A_0137)
 not that expensive (sw4886A_0140)
i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and  yeah no less than that (sw4886A_0141)
cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars altogether (sw4886A_0144)
i'd be surprised if it wasn't  anywhere (sw4886A_0156)
yeah (sw4886A_0158)
probably comes from where you are (sw4886A_0159)
when i drive through that area that's all i see no pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards (sw4886A_0166)
uh-huh (sw4886A_0172)
right (sw4886A_0178)
sex (sw4886A_0179)
yeah (sw4886A_0186)
my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and not to the back yard  you know they're going to doubt and lay in the sand and putting a papers on top of that (sw4886A_0187)
yeah (sw4886A_0188)
that's a lot easier (sw4886A_0190)
yeah (sw4886B_0002)
i'm not in the middle of anything (sw4886B_0003)
i've just (sw4886B_0004)
about last thing i did (sw4886B_0005)
about maybe so close to a year ago now i guess had and i help my dad had on another bedroom on to his house (sw4886B_0006)
so i guess that (sw4886B_0007)
was that was a fairly large undertaking (sw4886B_0010)
 it's it's a bedroom and walking closet and  bathroom all on one side of the house (sw4886B_0011)
 we did it all except for the sheet rocking (sw4886B_0013)
that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that (sw4886B_0015)
we don't we we weren't sure has to do that (sw4886B_0016)
opposite (sw4886B_0021)
we did all put the roof up and it all the roof and and put all the interior walls (sw4886B_0022)
we just didn't do any of the sheet rock well work (sw4886B_0023)
and that's it because you have to you know get those joints to go together (sw4886B_0024)
and whatever you have to put in there to get to to take the gap between the sheets on the ceiling and all that (sw4886B_0026)
and we didn't know anything about any of that (sw4886B_0028)
so (sw4886B_0029)
it it looked very hard to do (sw4886B_0031)
yeah (sw4886B_0032)
i figured well this (sw4886B_0033)
i don't think we can do it and make it look professional (sw4886B_0034)
so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living (sw4886B_0035)
but (sw4886B_0036)
probably so (sw4886B_0038)
we've never done it (sw4886B_0039)
so we just left it alone (sw4886B_0040)
but that's (sw4886B_0042)
i guess (sw4886B_0043)
i'm only twenty one (sw4886B_0044)
so  my my vast experience of of home homeowners knowledge is not very much (sw4886B_0045)
so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know from my parents (sw4886B_0046)
uh-huh (sw4886B_0047)
it was brand new (sw4886B_0050)
we started with the back yard and turn it into a part of the house (sw4886B_0053)
so it was (sw4886B_0054)
my my dad knew how to do most of it (sw4886B_0056)
he he had gotten a couple of books (sw4886B_0058)
and then he just started doing it (sw4886B_0059)
i don't know (sw4886B_0060)
well he did all the flooring himself (sw4886B_0061)
but the whole the whole floor and (sw4886B_0062)
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there (sw4886B_0063)
and then we were put us like  not not necessarily a garage but just like  off the side of that (sw4886B_0064)
after we had the house part made and just decided we carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less (sw4886B_0065)
it's not you know it's not in close (sw4886B_0066)
it's just somewhere to drive in the car to the park (sw4886B_0067)
and it's (sw4886B_0068)
 it's off the ground (sw4886B_0071)
uh-huh (sw4886B_0073)
found about  twenty two inch p or something like that (sw4886B_0074)
uh-huh (sw4886B_0079)
those are (sw4886B_0080)
we did those ourselves (sw4886B_0081)
yeah (sw4886B_0084)
so it's (sw4886B_0087)
and those are (sw4886B_0090)
i've done (sw4886B_0091)
somebody doing one of those before (sw4886B_0092)
those are (sw4886B_0093)
you can buy me kits (sw4886B_0094)
but we didn't do that way (sw4886B_0095)
but (sw4886B_0096)
yeah (sw4886B_0100)
yeah (sw4886B_0105)
yeah (sw4886B_0106)
it's not near like building a house or anything (sw4886B_0107)
but (sw4886B_0108)
yeah (sw4886B_0110)
those are nice (sw4886B_0111)
especially when you get done and you get something you know (sw4886B_0112)
i don't know (sw4886B_0113)
yeah (sw4886B_0114)
just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever having a barbeque (sw4886B_0115)
yeah (sw4886B_0120)
sounds nice (sw4886B_0121)
all done by yourself (sw4886B_0122)
yeah (sw4886B_0129)
yeah (sw4886B_0135)
that's pretty that's a good size (sw4886B_0136)
so yeah (sw4886B_0138)
yeah (sw4886B_0139)
yeah (sw4886B_0142)
that's good (sw4886B_0146)
that's not bad at all (sw4886B_0147)
have to (sw4886B_0148)
it would (sw4886B_0150)
that's surprising to the fact of how much would it you know (sw4886B_0151)
to get to get good lumber it cost (sw4886B_0152)
i don't know about dallas (sw4886B_0153)
but around even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all (sw4886B_0154)
i was surprised (sw4886B_0155)
it's probably more there (sw4886B_0157)
yeah (sw4886B_0160)
that it probably does (sw4886B_0162)
i don't i'm not sure (sw4886B_0164)
but (sw4886B_0165)
yeah (sw4886B_0167)
nothing but woods up and down here (sw4886B_0168)
yeah (sw4886B_0169)
i don't i haven't i haven't (sw4886B_0170)
i used to live in dallas in arlington actually (sw4886B_0171)
and but that was just when i was a kid (sw4886B_0173)
so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore (sw4886B_0174)
it's i don't know (sw4886B_0175)
college town (sw4886B_0176)
so that doesn't help without any (sw4886B_0177)
yeah (sw4886B_0180)
yeah (sw4886B_0181)
gases dollar dollar twelve a gallon (sw4886B_0182)
so that's probably about what you're paying (sw4886B_0183)
yeah (sw4886B_0189)
you got something going all the time (sw4886B_0191)
with regard to  to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though  jury trials are are  whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really though the only kinds of things that you can use because they the jurors prudent says you know based on   you know like humiliated you body of law (sw4890A_0001)
and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of a sudden they they start they can start going back and digging up all these cases that  that would be handled differently where they judge by today's standards (sw4890A_0002)
so i really don't think it they they can really do much of anything to change it (sw4890A_0004)
what do you think (sw4890A_0005)
maybe they used a little bit too much for us with stuff like that (sw4890A_0012)
but then then you know the defence lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently (sw4890A_0013)
and you know the other two guys sat in the car (sw4890A_0015)
they didn't get beat up yeah (sw4890A_0018)
and he got beat up because he he you know he you know he involve himself and some sub self destructive behavior (sw4890A_0021)
and   just like the burning the looting is self destruct (sw4890A_0023)
everybody says well this is the nineties (sw4890A_0025)
and they're going to rebuild (sw4890A_0027)
it'll be even better (sw4890A_0028)
hey what do you think (sw4890A_0029)
you know some some bad guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area (sw4890A_0030)
everybody would that mindset they they're they're they're going to that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto (sw4890A_0032)
and you might even be able to to use it for a for a bombing test site you know (sw4890A_0034)
everybody saying this is going to be a new here (sw4890A_0039)
we're going to reexamined this thing (sw4890A_0040)
hey above the average person who's going to take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed (sw4890A_0041)
they're a bunch of animals (sw4890A_0042)
how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything (sw4890A_0043)
forty deaths (sw4890A_0044)
i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that (sw4890A_0045)
and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how your way you know rodney getting getting that the hell beat 'em against you know forty deaths (sw4890A_0049)
yeah (sw4890A_0051)
and there's no other (sw4890A_0052)
i'm not sure exactly sure  what the circumstances surrounding the deaths (sw4890A_0053)
and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing (sw4890A_0054)
is it a litter that got shot by a store owner (sw4890A_0057)
uh-huh (sw4890A_0058)
no tears (sw4890A_0059)
yeah (sw4890A_0061)
and so i but i i suspect the number of (sw4890A_0062)
you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in the street (sw4890A_0064)
in my reaction is i would have run over fifty people before rather than stuff (sw4890A_0066)
and  and there would have been just and nothing but carthage after after if i had been at the wheel (sw4890A_0067)
no one would have stopped me (sw4890A_0069)
i'm inside the beltway (sw4890A_0075)
you know how capital gang they always say well for inside the belt way they think that (sw4890A_0077)
and so and i say well wait a minute (sw4890A_0078)
i'm inside the boat (sw4890A_0079)
i don't think like that (sw4890A_0080)
i'm a government employees (sw4890A_0082)
i'm with the f b i (sw4890A_0085)
yes (sw4890A_0088)
and so   and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because you know rick was another government employee wanting a speech segments of my speech that that were done a year ago (sw4890A_0089)
and he wanted another collection a year later (sw4890A_0091)
and so this is my seventh the call (sw4890A_0093)
a year ago i did eleven calls (sw4890A_0094)
and so that's that's why   that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate (sw4890A_0096)
uh-huh (sw4890B_0003)
i i don't think so (sw4890B_0006)
possibly in the jury selection would be the only (sw4890B_0007)
just for example what we're seeing in california i guess (sw4890B_0008)
it makes you wonder  had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome (sw4890B_0009)
 and and the problems that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of this witness what we did with the videotape dating  just makes you wonder i guess whether or not (sw4890B_0010)
yeah (sw4890B_0019)
yeah (sw4890B_0026)
that's right (sw4890B_0031)
and  (sw4890B_0033)
they're only going to suffer (sw4890B_0035)
they defeated themselves with what they're looting and violence (sw4890B_0036)
 i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even though the vast that aren't black or  don't live there whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the taste (sw4890B_0037)
and  (sw4890B_0038)
really ridiculous (sw4890B_0048)
against for any other people being (sw4890B_0050)
that (sw4890B_0055)
it is an bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what (sw4890B_0060)
 or or be (sw4890B_0065)
yeah (sw4890B_0070)
that's exactly how i feel too (sw4890B_0071)
i wouldn't have  they would have stopped my car for any anything at i seen them coming (sw4890B_0072)
but i was just wondering since you're you're in your back east  a little closer to the the bigger cities probably than we are in idaho (sw4890B_0073)
and what a section of the government (sw4890B_0084)
 that's interesting (sw4890B_0087)
uh-huh (sw4890B_0090)
 i see (sw4890B_0095)
and you said you have some strong feelings about the the issue (sw4902A_0001)
uh-huh (sw4902A_0004)
uh-huh (sw4902A_0012)
uh-huh (sw4902A_0017)
right (sw4902A_0021)
well i'm a little bit ambivalent (sw4902A_0023)
the problem with  and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problems that people are not willing to discuss it  in in terms of what i'm really is driving (sw4902A_0024)
they're not willing to tell the truth and the same way with   issues of race and things like that (sw4902A_0025)
i mean right now  i believe there are two policies that  that the government uses the modulator immigration (sw4902A_0026)
three actually (sw4902A_0027)
one is at the high end  (sw4902A_0028)
they always want to be able to  do some brain draining (sw4902A_0029)
it always like to be able to attract the  einstein so the professor (sw4902A_0030)
you are (sw4902A_0031)
they like to be able to get the top people in any field (sw4902A_0033)
so they can almost always find room for someone like that (sw4902A_0034)
the bottom end they  are always willing to  lay and cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business and some particular area and have strong support from the powerful people in that area (sw4902A_0035)
those are two things that i think of going on although they i don't think the the politicians would tell you that (sw4902A_0036)
and then the third thing is  the political aspect of   letting steam come out from under the bed and mexico (sw4902A_0039)
can not clothes off the mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico would be   would still over to this country (sw4902A_0040)
so they keep allowing  the pressure cooker too  let off steam (sw4902A_0041)
 that's one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with that you can not (sw4902A_0044)
i think they're very difficult group to integrate into  society (sw4902A_0045)
very difficult  group to find jobs and  and  places for (sw4902A_0046)
and so   i don't deny that we may have been involved and causing the problem that  and that they're pretty miserable where they are (sw4902A_0047)
i'm not too sympathetic about  letting large numbers of patience (sw4902A_0048)
right (sw4902A_0053)
but if you let them yeah we let him in a million at a time that wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a boat in the population (sw4902A_0054)
but politically in economics (sw4902A_0055)
well i know about it (sw4902A_0059)
i mean it's it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans or twenty years ago (sw4902A_0060)
the other hand you know the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial american spirit that first generation immigrants (sw4902A_0065)
so there's a there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in (sw4902A_0066)
sure (sw4902A_0070)
right (sw4902A_0072)
yes (sw4902B_0002)
do as far as  as far as  as far as integration as a whole goes (sw4902B_0003)
i think that  we simply must start accepting everybody in the world (sw4902B_0005)
wow (sw4902B_0007)
just is not going to be room for all of us (sw4902B_0008)
we don't have jobs now (sw4902B_0009)
i i think  i think we would come to a time of recession that particularly important that we shut our doors yvette (sw4902B_0010)
 i hope you're one of the employed right now (sw4902B_0011)
i am one of the unemployed right now (sw4902B_0013)
i was a systems analyst programmer for an oil company (sw4902B_0014)
and  i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings (sw4902B_0015)
but they had two thousand application (sw4902B_0016)
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners  here you know doing my line of work (sw4902B_0018)
of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job (sw4902B_0020)
so how do you feel (sw4902B_0022)
yeah (sw4902B_0032)
yeah (sw4902B_0037)
and i think you're right in both cases (sw4902B_0038)
i think probably it's pretty important (sw4902B_0042)
how do you feel about the haitian immigration (sw4902B_0043)
actually actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost a total population here (sw4902B_0049)
and it would have nothing to do with political situation (sw4902B_0051)
that would have to do with poverty (sw4902B_0052)
my gosh (sw4902B_0056)
have you been have you been to southern florida (sw4902B_0057)
well i mean and the two of 'em together (sw4902B_0061)
i mean we can (sw4902B_0062)
just as well (sw4902B_0063)
hardly america anymore (sw4902B_0064)
there's some differences in the immigrants that we're getting now (sw4902B_0067)
well and i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration (sw4902B_0068)
i think probably you're a great deal of what you say is true about legal (sw4902B_0071)
 the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into america (sw4902B_0073)
 they they don't bother to learn our language (sw4902B_0074)
and  first of all that (sw4902B_0075)
i really feel strongly about this (sw4902B_0076)
send a lot of money to mexico (sw4902B_0078)
around here we have a program where  we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspaper (sw4908A_0001)
keep the newspapers and  (sw4908A_0002)
they're collecting twice a month and the trash and that was bottled on the stuff that  is put in a in a little blue been picked up and sorted i into a truck (sw4908A_0003)
so they may have actually have about three passes at this collection one for the regular trash one for the  you know the bottles and cans of one for the newspapers (sw4908A_0004)
they do that on the truck (sw4908A_0008)
they separate them as they as they dumped them (sw4908A_0010)
and you know one guy comes around with this trucking dumps at all in there (sw4908A_0011)
and i think they're they're running out of  (sw4908A_0012)
sanitary landfill i think is when you're running and (sw4908A_0013)
of course  you being from new mexico you've probably been to washington especially if you're you're present location (sw4908A_0014)
you must have come to washington or at least once (sw4908A_0016)
right you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there (sw4908A_0024)
i mean there there there's gotta be occurred was between two mountains that nobody gives a doggone about the chicken you could use for landfill  (sw4908A_0027)
 what other what  what unique things you think  you can do about it and then what los alamos (sw4908A_0030)
other than (sw4908A_0032)
well isn't that  that's that's pretty  upscale trash or  situation (sw4908A_0037)
i don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals (sw4908A_0038)
well that certainly  you know getting into the swing of things (sw4908A_0048)
i i think it should be it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay (sw4908A_0049)
yeah everybody gets the you know five pounds of garbage thing they can throw away (sw4908A_0050)
but more than that every week  you gotta pay by the pound (sw4908A_0051)
i i think i think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff (sw4908A_0052)
well of course that  you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient and packing than any kind of a little household compact or (sw4908A_0060)
hum (sw4908B_0005)
but i gather you do not separate  the bottles and cans (sw4908B_0006)
uh-huh (sw4908B_0009)
yeah (sw4908B_0015)
yeah (sw4908B_0017)
i know (sw4908B_0018)
no i have i come to washington but  i find it very amusing that  the thing that was just instituted here is very similar (sw4908B_0019)
it is we also have blue bands (sw4908B_0020)
we also separate newspapers from all the other stuff which goes into the been and gets separated in the truck (sw4908B_0021)
and  landfills spaces indeed the driving factor here (sw4908B_0022)
and in fact  despite all of our open space out here landfills space is still  very hard to come by (sw4908B_0023)
yeah (sw4908B_0025)
but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will (sw4908B_0029)
well  (sw4908B_0031)
yeah (sw4908B_0033)
and looking at (sw4908B_0034)
 in fact los alamos  has  done a fair amount of research in recycling things in general (sw4908B_0035)
 it it involves for instance  creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium bury him and other things from  waste material in general and  and purify the waste of specific   nasty elements (sw4908B_0036)
and the other thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has a made some special  polymers that have the ability to  make certain active night elements that here to them (sw4908B_0039)
  they've  looked at  plutonium and uranium and  some other similar things to try to remove those from radioactive waste (sw4908B_0040)
and again this is driven by all of the documentation and  e._s. in age   considerations that  people are  worrying about i think much more than they should (sw4908B_0042)
actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable (sw4908B_0043)
back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the  paper from the computer center (sw4908B_0045)
and  in fact i think i was the first person or department to have my thesis published on recycled recycled paper (sw4908B_0046)
i think that's a wonderful idea (sw4908B_0053)
the only alternative i would see is  and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody is garbage would be a real pain  if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would  speak more directly to the space needed in the landfill (sw4908B_0054)
and it would also cause people to compaq their garbage more (sw4908B_0056)
 and  and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem that limiting the weight (sw4908B_0059)
my exercise program consists of  (sw4928A_0001)
it's a it's an opportunity to stay alive really instead of wasting my you know trying to exist on the late and save my youth good health in my youth (sw4928A_0002)
what i like to do is i like to stretch (sw4928A_0005)
and i like to run  (sw4928A_0006)
i like to run and get my heartbeat (sw4928A_0007)
like to run about  about two two and a half miles (sw4928A_0008)
and then i like to work out on  on the   the ballet life's a cycle machines up here at the at the holiday spa (sw4928A_0009)
and and and i i think that (sw4928A_0010)
i've had a regimen now for about ten fifteen years of of doing that (sw4928A_0011)
and  and i kinda think it's a it's a lot of work (sw4928A_0012)
but i think it's  it's (sw4928A_0013)
the  the amount of effort that's required to  to stay healthy (sw4928A_0014)
i have a sedentary job (sw4928A_0015)
and  unless you do something like that and you're going to get sick (sw4928A_0016)
well i  two years ago i started having trouble with my knee (sw4928A_0031)
and  you know i've got you know (sw4928A_0032)
i figure well go away (sw4928A_0033)
you know i'm i'm for head to reduce my program reduce my program (sw4928A_0034)
and i've gained fifteen pounds (sw4928A_0035)
and so  you know it's (sw4928A_0037)
need to get back into swimming you know instead of (sw4928A_0038)
i can't swim or can't run i should be able to swim (sw4928A_0039)
such a terrible swimmer (sw4928A_0040)
and i i really feel i can i can dedicated about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes to this  (sw4928A_0041)
but if it gets a longer than that i  it it i start not doing anything (sw4928A_0042)
so i i got a real problem in that regard (sw4928A_0044)
 it's (sw4928A_0045)
you obviously are are not an exercise (sw4928A_0047)
she'd be out there doing it (sw4928A_0048)
it's it's always a chore (sw4928A_0054)
i started doing this when i was about thirty five (sw4928A_0055)
and i'm fifty five (sw4928A_0058)
and  you know i i know that and the other day i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense (sw4928A_0060)
you know in some health related thing it's going to blow me away (sw4928A_0061)
same way (sw4928A_0062)
got too much weight on right now (sw4928A_0063)
i need to lose fifty pounds (sw4928A_0064)
i need to lose leaves twenty yeah (sw4928A_0066)
but  you know it's it's just  i'm busy (sw4928A_0067)
i'm doing a lot of traveling (sw4928A_0068)
and  it it creates a problem  you know when you're on the road (sw4928A_0069)
sort of   what other programs other than say running (sw4928A_0070)
have you ever done anything at all (sw4928A_0071)
well we're club or you with (sw4928A_0082)

right (sw4928A_0096)
well there's a there's a holiday spot down there on something like that (sw4928A_0097)
but  i i go to the holiday spot here in alexandria (sw4928A_0098)
and that's pretty good (sw4928A_0099)
but you know evening time it gets pretty busy (sw4928A_0100)
but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program yeah (sw4928A_0101)
but  you know i i need to i need to read dedicate myself to  to doing this (sw4928A_0103)
and  i got a problem  you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it (sw4928A_0104)
i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years (sw4928A_0105)
and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass (sw4928A_0107)
so i really don't want to want to  you know back off (sw4928A_0108)
 no (sw4928A_0116)
when you're young you you can abuse your your all your system (sw4928A_0117)
you can recovered (sw4928A_0118)
 when you get to be my age and you start abusing you systems you get blown away and just wind up having to kiss your ask goodbye (sw4928A_0120)
and  and so the object (sw4928A_0122)
right (sw4928B_0017)
i need to get (sw4928B_0019)
i'm pretty bad about that (sw4928B_0020)
lazy (sw4928B_0021)
should i (sw4928B_0022)
one i always say that i need to get running start running (sw4928B_0023)
going to try and do that this summer (sw4928B_0024)
so i never have time (sw4928B_0025)
i always put it off (sw4928B_0026)
by the time i get back from classes it's late at night (sw4928B_0027)
i don't feel like going back over the gym and running on the track or whatever (sw4928B_0028)
because i i'm i'm getting a (sw4928B_0029)
get back into shape (sw4928B_0030)
yeah (sw4928B_0043)
yeah (sw4928B_0049)
i mean i do i guess (sw4928B_0050)
i'm going to do it  because i want to get in shape (sw4928B_0051)
i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much though  i'll probably (sw4928B_0052)
i mean once they get into it and i if i if i get into better shape than it will be it won't be as much of a chore to me (sw4928B_0053)
yeah (sw4928B_0056)
yeah (sw4928B_0059)
yeah (sw4928B_0072)
uh-huh (sw4928B_0073)
 set up (sw4928B_0074)
 also last summer i was doing nautilus (sw4928B_0075)
last year  i belong to a club around here (sw4928B_0076)
that kind of expensive out to to rent (sw4928B_0077)
they went on their fifty dollars (sw4928B_0078)
little bit too much money (sw4928B_0080)
but  doing a mix of nautilus and free weights and i liked it (sw4928B_0081)
sorry (sw4928B_0083)
 what was it  city sports downtown washington (sw4928B_0085)
yeah (sw4928B_0088)
i'm  i'm going to george washington university (sw4928B_0089)
right (sw4928B_0093)
yeah (sw4928B_0102)
yeah (sw4928B_0106)
yeah (sw4928B_0110)
it's like  (sw4928B_0111)
she gets started getting into shape (sw4928B_0112)
i don't want to (sw4928B_0113)
i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it (sw4928B_0115)
yeah (sw4928B_0119)
yeah (sw4936A_0001)
things you already owned or things that you picked up just to do that (sw4936A_0006)
things who are already own (sw4936A_0008)
you pick 'em up just to do that (sw4936A_0009)
i've done both (sw4936A_0013)
 i have had my wife's picked up a couple of things thing  boy if we could refinished that that'd be a beautiful piece of furniture (sw4936A_0015)
and and we've done it a couple of times (sw4936A_0016)
i guess we've been fairly successful with (sw4936A_0017)
that's  that's the kind of a low risk sort of project and then i guess (sw4936A_0019)
 i have a a  really nice desk a nicer desperate i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital liberated after a fire (sw4936A_0022)
 we scripted all the way down and refinished it (sw4936A_0024)
turned out to be really nice  in the united states (sw4936A_0025)
top i think or or something of that (sw4936A_0026)
 really (sw4936A_0031)
 i'm jealous (sw4936A_0033)
uh-huh (sw4936A_0037)
yeah (sw4936A_0038)
i do do things  that might be too good to be called woodworking (sw4936A_0039)
build my own deck and  things like that (sw4936A_0040)
i definitely have begun to accumulate tools (sw4936A_0044)
yeah i picked up a bunch of craftsmen tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive (sw4936A_0045)
so i do have a band saw it a router and  things like that out in the garage (sw4936A_0047)
but i can't say i use them very often (sw4936A_0048)
are handy  they they come in handy at the most unusual time (sw4936A_0051)
putting doors in as the time when i'm (sw4936A_0053)
 i bought myself a a template from making more to says indoors (sw4936A_0054)
and that's a whole lot easier and doing it with a (sw4936A_0055)
but i've also i've also use them for buildings where are you  and  because  rabbit on my table on my  radio i'm still has a little bit on certain (sw4936A_0057)
so i got one for christmas a few years ago and use it quite a bit for the first eight months i had (sw4936A_0059)
no i use it twice a year maybe (sw4936A_0060)
 i guess (sw4936A_0067)
the ones that what (sw4936A_0070)
 i have never even i've never even looked at one closely (sw4936A_0072)
the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say  i would spend my money on the bits (sw4936A_0073)
 i have  i guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman rather (sw4936A_0076)
and the  (sw4936A_0077)
strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eight seven inch at a time (sw4936A_0079)
the problem is that the  has with (sw4936A_0080)
any time you buy 'em  tool with as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end (sw4936A_0081)
so the price of a good set of  car bide steal a bit since probably  i mean a a good set it bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars (sw4936A_0085)
and   if you're going to use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it (sw4936A_0086)
because  (sw4936A_0087)
imagine if i go and shop in them myself  it won't last (sw4936A_0088)
and i've never had the best sharp and (sw4936A_0089)
so that's the thing to consider (sw4936A_0090)
yeah (sw4936A_0093)
they'd they'd all after a while (sw4936A_0094)
especially i did some cabinets in   (sw4936A_0095)
and  that that wears a bit down (sw4936A_0097)
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice cabinets  which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen (sw4936A_0098)
and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabin out of another by using the faces and so forth (sw4936A_0101)
and  routing hardwood will take the edge of a cheap that pretty fast (sw4936A_0102)
right (sw4936A_0107)
that's (sw4936A_0108)
and then you take the blade to get sharp it right (sw4936A_0110)
yeah (sw4936A_0116)
well i use mine on treated (sw4936A_0117)
now all my blades need shopping 'cause  treated will also to him up (sw4936A_0118)
i don't know (sw4936B_0002)
i  i refinished a couple  old dresser or get handed down (sw4936B_0003)
it's nice tongue groove  construction (sw4936B_0004)
  i've been pretty successful that (sw4936B_0005)
what (sw4936B_0007)
yeah (sw4936B_0010)
i've got some other things too  you know (sw4936B_0011)
yeah (sw4936B_0014)
right (sw4936B_0018)
that's a good way to get started (sw4936B_0021)
i put together  i  role top desk from scratch (sw4936B_0030)
okay (sw4936B_0032)
still had to cut it and everything (sw4936B_0035)
that's fine (sw4936B_0036)
uh-huh (sw4936B_0041)
yeah (sw4936B_0042)
i've done the same you know like the trim around the house and you know the base boards and things (sw4936B_0043)
uh-huh (sw4936B_0046)
i'm looking at trying to get her out or right now (sw4936B_0050)
i'll bet (sw4936B_0056)
yeah (sw4936B_0061)
my my brother's music a lot for making drawers (sw4936B_0062)
i don't know (sw4936B_0063)
what's your opinion of a good routers like (sw4936B_0065)
yeah (sw4936B_0066)
because he was telling me like the ones that you dial in our and all that great (sw4936B_0068)
plastic parts and stuff (sw4936B_0069)
