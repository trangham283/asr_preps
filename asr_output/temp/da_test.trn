okay (2121A_0000)
could you tell me what you think contributes most to  apple motion (2121A_0001)
 wow you talked about  volcanos (2121A_0005)
i'm not sure how many active volcanoes around now and and what the amount of material that they do put into the atmosphere (2121A_0006)
i think probably the greatest cause is  vehicles especially around and cities (2121A_0007)
 do you live right in the city itself (2121A_0010)
okay (2121A_0014)
so you can you know (2121A_0015)
well it's it's (2121A_0018)
i live in a rural area (2121A_0019)
 it's mainly farms and  no heavy industry (2121A_0021)
itself (2121A_0022)
i live in rhode island (2121A_0023)
and that's in the north (2121A_0025)
of up in the northeast corner (2121A_0026)
and and just all over the line t._i.s plant (2121A_0027)
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry (2121A_0030)
there's the freeway (2121A_0031)
then we got an occasional (2121A_0032)
depends which way the wind's blowing from boston because we're in like about forty miles south of boston (2121A_0033)
so  pick up (2121A_0034)
and  i've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years (2121A_0035)
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport (2121A_0036)
and i never fly patterns now is the jets that they're getting bigger (2121A_0037)
the swinging wide us a lot of coming over the over the homes (2121A_0038)
and it seems like   what catching all i resident (2121A_0040)
i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping (2121A_0041)
but other than that you know we don't have the unless they're catching up from the midwest the emissions and have no power plants  (2121A_0042)
yeah (2121A_0046)
yeah (2121A_0047)
we generate (2121A_0048)
one of my my biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to generate electricity (2121A_0049)
 that doesn't seem to be much in mission from them (2121A_0052)
but i'm not sure about the rest of the country (2121A_0053)
right (2121A_0060)
yeah (2121A_0066)
surprise surprise (2121A_0067)
yeah (2121A_0070)
that must be   some of the some of the   logic plants i brought up around one twenty eight (2121A_0071)
 we've got reports that  (2121A_0073)
during the night too like they blow off there stacks from  the house powerhouses (2121A_0074)
and they do that at night too because he's been complaining that the cause of been petted and you know spots all over (2121A_0078)
so you're right (2121A_0083)
they could do something about that i guess (2121A_0084)
how old are your  your lakes (2121A_0087)
and  (2121A_0088)
they have (2121A_0090)
acid rain (2121A_0095)
yeah (2121A_0096)
that's that's what i was  (2121A_0097)
yeah (2121A_0101)
yeah (2121A_0102)
didn't they just have an article on  (2121A_0103)
that would dumping line (2121A_0104)
upstate new york somewhere  although although the huge areas (2121A_0106)
and they thought that was more beneficial because of you know it some of it does so (2121A_0110)
some of it runs off right away into the into the streams of rivers (2121A_0111)
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback (2121A_0112)
i can't remember where (2121A_0114)
i read that recently somewhere (2121A_0115)
i can't remember where (2121A_0116)
i thought it was up there (2121A_0119)
so that's interesting because new hampshire and lots of vermont  they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to asset rain (2121A_0120)
 you kind of think of something else (2121A_0124)
 they didn't say they didn't say what (2121A_0127)
they just said they thought it was (2121A_0128)
natural disease (2121A_0131)
yeah (2121A_0135)
yeah (2121A_0136)
 we can demand more efficient only bills for one thing (2121A_0139)
i still think that's that's  one of our nature causes of the little ones (2121A_0140)
 i like all about that it's   it's a little bit difficult (2121A_0142)
yeah (2121A_0144)
you didn't i think in need of  a vehicle something like   ralph nader natives rate is  you know with  or   which has a lot of members  if you can get those types of groups (2121A_0147)
yeah (2121A_0158)
they are better (2121A_0159)
but how about all my truck some buses that are out there (2121A_0160)
when's the last time you saw a truck i didn't smoke or (2121A_0161)
 i'm not really sure (2121A_0164)
do you think that that the  the fucking industries that  incompetent that they wouldn't (2121A_0165)
feel as as one of the biggest costs (2121A_0166)
so you would (2121A_0168)
yeah (2121A_0170)
vince (2121A_0171)
yeah (2121A_0175)
yeah (2121A_0176)
it could also  push for legislation for a rapid transit system (2121A_0177)
this country seems to be a little behind on now (2121A_0178)
 yeah (2121A_0181)
but only because we've got used to a single person single car driving (2121A_0182)
a lotta people don't even like the capital (2121A_0185)
you could do that (2121A_0187)
that'll help pollution yeah pollution (2121A_0188)
they  united states and canada or i guess going into some types of agreements don't limit  what's being given out by power plants (2121A_0191)
i guess candidates quite concerned that we're sending a lot about stuff up there (2121A_0193)
so that's helping (2121A_0196)
now that's an idea (2121A_0199)
say that too loud though 'cause  every city and i don't have a meat around here to help like generally generate revenue (2121A_0200)
that's a that's an interesting concept (2121A_0208)
is that your idea (2121A_0209)
well i went to go to (2121A_0214)
right (2121A_0215)
you could put it in the you could that could be installed on like a kind of would have been (2121A_0216)
i guess you can take those off (2121A_0218)
yeah (2121A_0222)
you can take 'em off a little off and on replaced (2121A_0223)
well not unless there was built in every muscle (2121A_0224)
and that's (2121A_0226)
that's quite a concept (2121A_0230)
you should  pursue that i think  (2121A_0231)
if you could come up with a device that's the thing (2121A_0235)
it shouldn't be too hot to do something like that (2121A_0237)
that's a that's a thought (2121A_0238)
right (2121A_0241)
and that will solve a lot of problems (2121A_0242)
i don't know a few  if you approach the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that (2121A_0243)
 but you know a proposal to   i guess the proper authorities (2121A_0245)
okay it might  generate some (2121A_0247)
yeah (2121A_0250)
it might generate some interest in it (2121A_0251)
but that's a that's a good idea (2121A_0252)
other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved with a group or an organization (2121A_0253)
well it's hard to say (2121B_0002)
i mean while it certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories  pollute a lot  if you look at how much pollution is they kicked up by an active volcano  it certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things as much effect at all (2121B_0003)
what do you think (2121B_0004)
more out in the suburbs (2121B_0012)
but i certainly work near a city (2121B_0013)
how 'bout you (2121B_0016)
yeah (2121B_0024)
yeah (2121B_0039)
i mean like from (2121B_0045)
i've noticed local a a major problem this kodak (2121B_0055)
 it's interesting (2121B_0056)
because in order to  keep with the epa standards which which tend to be visible  what's coming out of your smoke stack they do all their missions at night (2121B_0057)
so people get up (2121B_0058)
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood (2121B_0062)
and they've got this blackout on their cars which you know seems to be (2121B_0063)
i mean i really think of the epa had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorus grenades light up a sky photograph the emissions at that point and  (2121B_0069)
right (2121B_0079)
yeah (2121B_0081)
yeah (2121B_0082)
yeah (2121B_0085)
it seems a little ridiculous (2121B_0086)
 i've been getting cleaner (2121B_0089)
sure (2121B_0091)
but  (2121B_0092)
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain (2121B_0093)
yeah (2121B_0094)
the stuff i've read recently and technology review basically indicates that acid rained maybe a little bit  over stated that a lot of the die off they've seen and forests may not really be due to asset rain at all (2121B_0098)
hum (2121B_0099)
not an expert (2121B_0100)
i haven't read that (2121B_0107)
 yeah (2121B_0109)
   well that's what they environmentalist or climbing and this article (2121B_0125)
sort of (2121B_0126)
they didn't say what (2121B_0129)
they just said they thought acid arrange contribution maybe lesson was previously suspected  that maybe other natural things at work  (2121B_0130)
yeah (2121B_0132)
so it's it's less than (2121B_0133)
i guess i don't remember the article that well (2121B_0134)
but  i don't know (2121B_0137)
i mean what do you think we can  i guess as individuals or as a group do about  air pollution (2121B_0138)
it's just up to individuals to ask auto makers for  plus polluting vehicles (2121B_0143)
yeah (2121B_0148)
do you really think new vehicles that was a big problem (2121B_0152)
i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's the older pull it or (2121B_0153)
the twelve and a fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution (2121B_0154)
 new cars it's hardly us hardly anything (2121B_0157)
doesn't that just means they're out of town (2121B_0163)
right (2121B_0167)
diesel insurance (2121B_0169)
you know it's (2121B_0172)
they do generate a lot of (2121B_0173)
least you know that kind of particular comes out of the air pretty quickly (2121B_0174)
yeah (2121B_0179)
on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit 'cause it's so inconvenient (2121B_0180)
yeah (2121B_0194)
sure (2121B_0195)
 what do you think about like  devise a meter ran on (2121B_0197)
pay the tax based on how much you pull it (2121B_0198)
well it just means that if you don't pollute writer you probably have very little you don't have to pay any tax (2121B_0201)
there you just buy one of these things (2121B_0202)
and it it (2121B_0203)
you could you could probably devise them so it's slowly closed off your tail (2121B_0204)
and  the less you pollute the longer that device last (2121B_0205)
and if you pull it a lot and they closed off your tail (2121B_0206)
and you couldn't start your car any more (2121B_0207)
yeah (2121B_0210)
but  you know it's  (2121B_0211)
i guess the difficult it would be somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again (2121B_0212)
so you'd probably have to build it right into the muscle or (2121B_0213)
right (2121B_0217)
you could take (2121B_0220)
but my to be a little more obvious if you took that off (2121B_0221)
right (2121B_0225)
if you were talking about something which was more or less universal but buses and any kind of vehicle pollution tax  this would penalize that heavy (2121B_0227)
yeah (2121B_0232)
that's a good idea (2121B_0234)
right (2121B_0236)
yeah (2121B_0248)
immobile regulatory agencies are so (2121B_0249)
 just about any kind of music except pass it (2131A_0001)
i don't care for it right (2131A_0003)
 i grew up with current tree in west (2131A_0007)
just about any county (2131A_0012)
like classical music (2131A_0013)
yeah (2131A_0020)
yeah (2131A_0022)
i grew up with snow and let's see for sale and hank williams and all of those old country and western show (2131A_0023)
but  (2131A_0026)
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two games go away (2131A_0027)
that was fabulous (2131A_0034)
yeah (2131A_0039)
when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to yeah just 'cause he can make that flew to say (2131A_0040)
yeah (2131A_0044)
and it was tremendous (2131A_0045)
yeah (2131A_0049)
yeah (2131A_0055)
and it was  mostly all irish too (2131A_0057)
yeah they had a band with him that  had a heart fished and another flu and then the guy that played bagpipes plus the  yeah and a couple of our land and  drum (2131A_0060)
and they they play it all the irish eggs and so forth (2131A_0064)
it was just fabulous (2131A_0065)
ground so  (2131A_0070)
much of a new stuff (2131A_0078)
yeah (2131A_0082)
i love  i i especially like instrumental (2131A_0083)
yeah (2131A_0085)
i love to just lay back on the couch and and turner good good instrument alone and just closed my eyes malicious (2131A_0086)
that (2131A_0091)
i never played an instrument in my life (2131A_0092)
always wanted to (2131A_0093)
i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something (2131A_0095)
right (2131A_0098)
but  i just love to be able to go to party or something and set air at the piano and buying out music (2131A_0100)
i was never that brave but  yeah  (2131A_0102)
i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music kissing and then the choir yeah (2131A_0105)
yeah (2131A_0109)
time (2131A_0111)
well like i say (2131A_0115)
just do not (2131A_0116)
i don't know i don't care for rap music  (2131A_0117)
i know that (2131A_0121)
if i can't understand the words i don't listen to it (2131A_0125)
you know not exciting (2131A_0132)
it doesn't give you relaxation you can't dance too you can't do anything (2131A_0136)
yeah and i love  i like the arc for music too like the boston pops yeah or anything (2131A_0137)
yeah (2131A_0149)
yeah (2131A_0151)
good (2131A_0152)
i know yeah we went and saw a late late les miserables (2131A_0155)
 the music and that was fantastic i (2131A_0159)
yeah (2131A_0161)
yeah (2131A_0163)
yeah (2131A_0164)
i can't remember how far in advance way reserved (2131A_0165)
but it was that you know at the state prior music (2131A_0168)
and that was a real it was well worth the price (2131A_0169)
was it  (2131A_0175)
hi there (2131A_0177)
just just every so often yeah you know a real a real good when like that (2131A_0181)
yeah (2131A_0184)
we went and saw i think it was a sugar babies (2131A_0186)
that was good (2131A_0187)

uh-huh (2131A_0206)
yeah (2131A_0210)
right (2131A_0212)
yeah (2131A_0215)
 yeah (2131A_0218)
yeah (2131A_0219)
my language (2131A_0221)
yeah (2131A_0226)
alabama (2131A_0229)
yeah (2131A_0241)
either alabama or hank williams (2131A_0243)
right (2131A_0245)
and i never have figured out how he won the entertaining or the year  three or four years in a row (2131A_0247)
we enjoyed watching that country and the grammys and stuff but i just i just don't care for him yeah (2131A_0253)
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western so our singer is  probably eighty or (2131A_0256)
right i i think i i know who that is i think my parents have have  some of his records but yeah  i got i got about a hundred and  had   some  show some of my head about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight rpm records of country in west wow (2131A_0263)
smiley burnett i don't know if you're old enough to remember him (2131A_0268)
he was  played in the old western movies (2131A_0270)
he was a sad (2131A_0271)
 are like (2131A_0273)
i think his name on the in the movie was frog (2131A_0274)
yeah (2131A_0279)
some of those old ones course bob boils finished texas playboy's yeah ernest to read so early and (2131A_0282)
i took 'em up here too collectors record records and was able to get a lot of money farm (2131A_0288)
but  i'm a mother and daddy used to own a restaurant (2131A_0290)
 yeah i had a they had a  nickelodeon course in the restaurant yeah (2131A_0294)
when they would come and change the records the guys would and the guy would give her the old records (2131A_0296)
so that's where i (2131A_0299)
yeah (2131A_0301)
yeah of course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight rpm rain (2131A_0303)
well the problem is the most of the record player play them because i have to have that need that to protect our kind of neat or (2131A_0306)
and they just won't play on a modern day  that's a shame (2131A_0310)
yeah (2131A_0317)
yeah (2131A_0324)
course they you know just don't have the quality of records paradise either now you get that (2131A_0328)
yeah (2131A_0333)
really (2131A_0338)
yeah (2131A_0342)
at all not neither tapes  and i bike we bought cassette tapes and machines will eat them yeah (2131A_0345)
right (2131A_0349)
but i i guess you know the old country and western music (2131A_0354)
back then when i was a kid there wasn't that much tv (2131A_0355)
 that's all you had to listen to is the right (2131A_0357)
yeah (2131A_0367)
yeah really (2131A_0369)
yeah (2131A_0373)
i remember my dad always turned on the grand old opry (2131A_0378)
yeah (2131A_0380)

was it (2131B_0174)
 i bet it was (2131B_0176)
i really thought it was (2131B_0178)

black hair (2131B_0200)
yeah (2131B_0202)
okay (2131B_0203)
i know i can't think of (2131B_0204)
yeah (2131B_0207)
well that was that was (2131B_0208)
i remember that being a here a few years ago (2131B_0209)
 the last century (2131B_0213)
my parents still really like country music (2131B_0214)
and they they like  they liked the oak ridge boys brothers (2131B_0217)
and   my my parents (2131B_0220)
yeah (2131B_0223)
my husband likes  country music really (2131B_0224)
he he like some of the new groups like shenandoah (2131B_0225)
and (2131B_0227)
he really likes shenandoah (2131B_0228)
yeah (2131B_0230)
yeah (2131B_0231)
yeah (2131B_0232)
yeah (2131B_0233)
i i think they are but over expose (2131B_0235)
i get kinda get tired of every other solving alabama on the radio (2131B_0238)
 i i've never cared for hank williams junior (2131B_0244)
i (2131B_0248)
 we we watch those award shows too (2131B_0250)
we enjoyed watching that country and the grammys and stuff (2131B_0251)
but i just i just don't care for him (2131B_0252)
i just never have (2131B_0254)
i don't (2131B_0255)
it is it (2131B_0257)
okay (2131B_0259)
i i think i i know who that is (2131B_0260)
i think my parents have have some of his records (2131B_0262)
yeah (2131B_0264)
wow (2131B_0266)
i've heard the name (2131B_0269)
i've never seen a g not true movie (2131B_0276)
yeah (2131B_0280)
i never have (2131B_0281)
yeah (2131B_0283)
go (2131B_0286)
yeah (2131B_0289)
it's hard to (2131B_0291)
 yeah (2131B_0293)
yeah (2131B_0295)
well that would (2131B_0297)
that's neat (2131B_0298)
that'd be great they weren't too worn out at the time (2131B_0300)
they're not (2131B_0304)
you'd you'd think there would be (2131B_0305)
well that's true (2131B_0307)
 yeah (2131B_0309)
 that's a shame (2131B_0313)
cause i i we go to antique stores (2131B_0315)
you see seventy eight a lot at the store record store (2131B_0316)
think that'd be a market for (2131B_0319)
i'm sure you could find old players (2131B_0322)
but that cost a fortune if you could find them network (2131B_0323)
no (2131B_0329)
well those things were big in sick once a day (2131B_0332)
so you could kill so (2131B_0335)
the one (2131B_0339)
go out and buy one now (2131B_0340)
they're just so thin lindsay (2131B_0341)
and they just they're not meant to last at all (2131B_0344)
nah neither tapes (2131B_0347)
and i bike we bought cassette tapes (2131B_0348)
and the machines will eat them (2131B_0350)
it did so their best bet any any more these days that compaq this (2131B_0352)
those things are practically indestructible (2131B_0353)
 no (2131B_0356)
radio (2131B_0358)
yeah that that's just what this is what you have (2131B_0361)
plus (2131B_0363)
i think it was better back then too (2131B_0365)
the there's too much tv now (2131B_0366)
and the radio was you know more exciting really than than television (2131B_0368)
yeah (2131B_0371)
your imagination (2131B_0372)
you kept (2131B_0374)
yeah (2131B_0375)
just didn't vegetate your mind like television (2131B_0376)
 yeah (2131B_0379)
is that on the radio every week (2131B_0381)
what what what day was that (2131B_0383)
you you can you recall (2131B_0384)
okay (2151A_0001)
well i i think it's a pretty good deal (2151A_0004)
i think they should either that or or or for some time to the military or helping elderly people (2151A_0005)
i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help (2151A_0009)
and i think that before we expand our young talent overseas and and help other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home (2151A_0010)
i'm not sure that that's not a bad idea (2151A_0011)
all the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad (2151A_0014)
i think it teaches kids how to grow (2151A_0017)
how 'bout yourself (2151A_0018)
yeah (2151A_0027)
that's really great (2151A_0028)
i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts excellent to excellent organizations (2151A_0029)
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that (2151A_0032)
and they don't follow it at all (2151A_0035)
very few colds go on and become eagle scouts (2151A_0036)
and i don't know hiring because of the gals (2151A_0039)
but (2151A_0040)
senior (2151A_0044)
okay (2151A_0045)
so there's not (2151A_0046)
yup (2151A_0049)
they lose interest (2151A_0050)
and when they're young young adults even less interest (2151A_0052)
they are more for i guess (2151A_0055)
yeah (2151A_0057)
yeah (2151A_0058)
yeah (2151A_0063)
you're absolutely right (2151A_0064)
i think it's a really a good thing (2151A_0067)
i like the (2151A_0068)
causes you know third world countries that can use all kind of help (2151A_0069)
i think we ought to start right here at home (2151A_0072)
uh-huh (2151A_0075)
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here (2151A_0081)
and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook (2151A_0082)
it's been really good (2151A_0084)
we talked about this for a few minutes (2151A_0085)
and hopefully we'll have another topic maybe another call some day (2151A_0086)
but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic (2151A_0087)
yeah we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do some time (2151A_0090)
well you didn't care (2151A_0094)
and and enjoy the day (2151A_0095)
yeah (2151A_0099)
bye bye (2151A_0100)
right (2151B_0000)
or do you think about the idea of  kids having to do public service work for (2151B_0002)
you think it's  (2151B_0003)
yes (2151B_0006)
yeah (2151B_0007)
that's (2151B_0008)
that's true (2151B_0012)
yeah (2151B_0015)
i agree with you (2151B_0019)
  what i'm thinking about is back well when i was a kid in much earlier than that kids were kind of (2151B_0020)
you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts and girl scouts (2151B_0021)
and i do do do do a lot of public service activities (2151B_0022)
these days they're not  (2151B_0023)
parents are encouraging their kids to do things like that (2151B_0024)
cause when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part of of of the scouting and you know (2151B_0025)
they are (2151B_0030)
parents (2151B_0031)
yeah (2151B_0033)
i do (2151B_0034)
 no (2151B_0037)
senior (2151B_0042)
 they're just not (2151B_0047)
once they get into junior high it's just not done any more (2151B_0048)
yeah (2151B_0056)
right (2151B_0059)
right (2151B_0060)
uh-huh (2151B_0061)
yeah (2151B_0065)
yeah (2151B_0070)
there's a lot that can be done right here in this country too (2151B_0071)
yeah (2151B_0076)
 i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for for  a lot of young people (2151B_0077)
since there is much that needs to be done here (2151B_0080)
now (2151B_0088)
 i agree with you (2151B_0089)
yeah (2151B_0091)
 okay (2151B_0093)
you too (2151B_0098)
are you on a regular regular exercise program right now (2229A_0000)
 well i'm kinda off and on (2229A_0005)
right now i'm kind of  (2229A_0009)
okay (2229A_0012)
what type of exercise do you do (2229A_0013)
okay (2229A_0016)
i guess you don't enjoy that very much (2229A_0017)
find that to be boring (2229A_0019)
yeah (2229A_0025)
well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring (2229A_0027)
but (2229A_0029)
i haven't decided whether you're whether i want to play it or not (2229A_0032)
i just bought myself a solo flex (2229A_0033)
i don't know if you've seen those advertised on tv (2229A_0034)
it's one of those  universal time machines exercise machine (2229A_0036)
but i haven't really sat down and use it much yet (2229A_0037)
so it's collecting dust right now (2229A_0038)
they used to jog somewhat (2229A_0042)
that's good (2229A_0048)
my parents have a treadmill (2229A_0050)
yeah (2229A_0051)
when i go visit them  i get on that thing every now and (2229A_0052)
just got the bicycle out today (2229A_0056)
and it was real nice outside (2229A_0057)
had to get up to do something (2229A_0058)
i've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold (2229A_0062)
so i thought i'd better a better get outside and do something not waste a day (2229A_0063)
but  (2229A_0069)
i need to start jogging again (2229A_0070)
i've always found that to be   really one of the best forms of exercise (2229A_0071)
but it's terribly boring (2229A_0072)
and so i really don't ever keep  a program up consistently (2229A_0073)
no (2229A_0075)
i never have (2229A_0076)
well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries (2229A_0077)
usually only go about a mile or two (2229A_0078)
yeah (2229A_0080)
it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete ron asphalt (2229A_0082)
supposed to be much better if he signed  grass or or  dirt to jog (2229A_0085)
have to have the right type of  shoes too (2229A_0088)
that's very important (2229A_0091)
yeah (2229A_0098)
i don't have to buy jogging she's all too often (2229A_0099)
don't get very much (2229A_0100)
i usually enjoy the exercise i do (2229A_0103)
but  like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining up a program (2229A_0104)
so i'll i'll bicycle (2229A_0105)
get into that for a for a little while and maybe go out on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for a while (2229A_0106)
but then i'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out and three or four nights a week (2229A_0107)
but  that gets all too and very short order (2229A_0111)
i'm hoping that this  solo flex solo  change things a little bit (2229A_0113)
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis (2229A_0114)
yeah (2229A_0118)
maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again the spring i can start some type of  regular programs (2229A_0120)
i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals gets a lot easier to keep  keep something going (2229A_0123)
i when i was in high school we had a choice of taking a physical education courses on exercise (2229A_0125)
and  one of those involved in six weeks i should not in universal machine lifting weights and  working out like that (2229A_0126)
and that was very helpful (2229A_0129)
and we kept charts of our progress and  consistently  increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks (2229A_0130)
i found that to be very helpful (2229A_0133)
 i need to (2229A_0135)
i haven't started yet (2229A_0137)
but it's a thought (2229A_0138)
sounds like something i should do (2229A_0140)
 how often do you  go out each week and you're walking (2229A_0145)
okay (2229A_0150)
how far how far do you go walking (2229A_0151)
okay (2229A_0155)
 that's good (2229A_0157)
say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging (2229A_0158)
yeah (2229A_0160)
sure (2229A_0162)
well if you keep up a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going  (2229A_0165)
yeah (2229A_0167)
yeah (2229A_0171)
but it's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is (2229A_0173)
do you go to an aerobics class (2229A_0179)
to to watch on tv (2229A_0180)
okay (2229A_0185)
which shows do you watch on tv (2229A_0187)
 okay (2229A_0190)
okay (2229A_0191)
 cathy smith workout (2229A_0192)
jane fonda (2229A_0194)
okay (2229A_0196)
right (2229A_0198)
hi every now and then i'll watch espn (2229A_0199)
i get cable on tv (2229A_0200)
and they have  a couple of shows called basic training (2229A_0202)
and  what is the other one (2229A_0203)
buddies emotion that's that's the name of that when i was thinking you know with killed (2229A_0211)
yeah (2229A_0219)
he's not bad (2229A_0220)
his assistance usually aren't either (2229A_0221)
they're always in in hawaii someplace on on the on the beach (2229A_0225)
yeah (2229A_0230)
well they they do low impact stuff (2229A_0231)
and they're on every day (2229A_0232)
yup (2229A_0238)
every morning (2229A_0239)
it's on espn (2229A_0241)
what time (2229A_0242)
i can't remember what time (2229A_0243)
it's  you know (2229A_0244)
i can't remember offhand what time (2229A_0245)
that show (2229A_0247)
now (2229A_0252)
i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on tv (2229A_0255)
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day monday through friday case you're interested in that (2229A_0257)
i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there (2229A_0260)
but  i haven't done so much as  watch the tape (2229A_0264)
i'm kinda bad about that myself (2229A_0268)
well i sure enjoyed talking to you about to exercise and fitness (2229A_0273)
so all right (2229A_0278)
yeah (2229A_0280)
yeah (2229A_0282)
yes (2229B_0001)
and i hate it (2229B_0002)
how 'bout you (2229B_0004)
okay (2229B_0006)
well i guess i've been kind of off and on (2229B_0007)
 had some health problems that has led me to us (2229B_0008)
say more on that (2229B_0011)
 i do walking on the treadmill (2229B_0014)
and then i did while we impact or (2229B_0015)
not not really (2229B_0018)
yeah (2229B_0020)
and time consuming (2229B_0021)
i mean it's it's not just say exercise that's boring and time consuming (2229B_0022)
 yeah afterwards you know (2229B_0023)
then you have to take a shower and get claim that (2229B_0024)
yeah do you go to go through like every year (2229B_0030)
yeah (2229B_0039)
a lot of things do that (2229B_0040)
i haven't i had an exercise bike (2229B_0041)
i used to have one (2229B_0044)
and finally got rid of it 'cause i never used it (2229B_0045)
but i do use my treadmill (2229B_0046)
yeah (2229B_0053)
it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse (2229B_0054)
yeah (2229B_0059)
i can't remember by (2229B_0060)
so (2229B_0061)
you know (2229B_0067)
since you know i said well we can (2229B_0068)
 your head injuries from talking (2229B_0074)
that's what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and that you know you can end up getting hurt or worse (2229B_0079)
yeah (2229B_0086)
not quite so easy (2229B_0087)
yeah (2229B_0092)
yeah (2229B_0094)
i found that true especially for walking and tell a difference (2229B_0095)
i guess my break down about they say that every six months (2229B_0101)
yeah (2229B_0112)
yeah (2229B_0115)
nice to exercise my desk and (2229B_0117)
wow (2229B_0119)
yeah (2229B_0121)
yeah (2229B_0122)
can do that (2229B_0134)
well that sounds like something good to do and (2229B_0139)
yeah (2229B_0141)
that's why i just start off i mean okay (2229B_0142)
well i do (2229B_0146)
switch every other day (2229B_0147)

yeah right now about a mile and a half (2229B_0154)
try to work it's three miles (2229B_0156)
yeah (2229B_0159)
it takes it's is it it takes longer to get the same effect (2229B_0161)
yeah (2229B_0163)
but (2229B_0164)
i walk when broke (2229B_0166)
 upset (2229B_0168)
i just have to turn the stereo (2229B_0170)
yeah (2229B_0174)

and (2229B_0176)
my treadmill has an incline (2229B_0177)

i use tapes (2229B_0189)
 richard simmons (2229B_0193)
sweating to the old days (2229B_0197)
there was one guy used to watch on espn (2229B_0204)
and i don't know if he's still on it any more now (2229B_0205)
i don't know if i get espn and (2229B_0206)
but  one yeah (2229B_0208)
used to watch i watch one on there (2229B_0209)
that was bad (2229B_0210)
yeah (2229B_0212)
yeah (2229B_0213)
yeah (2229B_0215)
yeah (2229B_0217)
 i checked 'cause he was cute (2229B_0218)
yeah (2229B_0226)
yeah (2229B_0227)
then that was back when  yeah the high impact and (2229B_0229)
do they (2229B_0233)
yeah (2229B_0235)
yeah (2229B_0236)
they're so they're still he's still doing it then  (2229B_0237)
too yeah (2229B_0240)
i like to check in check check it back up (2229B_0246)
and the thing is everybody always look so good on that show at least on (2229B_0250)
some of the other way not everybody has a picture perfect body (2229B_0253)
i haven't watched any other ones on tv  just on some of the tank (2229B_0256)
 okay (2229B_0261)
right (2229B_0262)
that's a thought (2229B_0265)
 that's the time (2229B_0269)
yeah yeah (2229B_0270)
well they're going to beep us pretty soon (2229B_0271)
nice talking to you yeah (2229B_0274)
okay (2229B_0276)
things (2229B_0277)
do you like (2229B_0279)
yeah (2229B_0281)
 the causes of crimes (2335A_0001)
 i think it was in balance of power in the united states (2335A_0002)
that's causing a lower class to rebel (2335A_0003)
that's why there's such high crime (2335A_0004)
 there's crime in  young people because they don't ever role models (2335A_0005)
see too much crime on tv (2335A_0007)
i think it's the way to go (2335A_0008)
i know (2335A_0009)
what do you think (2335A_0010)
yeah (2335A_0016)
okay (2335A_0018)
yeah (2335A_0020)
okay (2335A_0023)
yeah (2335A_0029)
from anybody else (2335A_0031)
yeah (2335A_0034)
yeah (2335A_0037)
yeah (2335A_0039)
i think i can agree with that too (2335A_0040)
that's true (2335A_0044)
you got to kind of people want to do the right thing (2335A_0045)
i don't know how you do that (2335A_0047)
yeah (2335A_0051)
i've heard this one theory that if you have a kid commits a crime that there instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parents (2335A_0053)
are both of them (2335A_0054)
yeah to put the blame on the parents (2335A_0056)
yeah (2335A_0059)
yeah (2335A_0062)
yeah (2335A_0064)
yeah (2335A_0066)
yeah (2335A_0071)
yeah (2335A_0075)
nah (2335A_0081)
i didn't see it (2335A_0082)
yeah (2335A_0088)
yeah (2335A_0090)
yeah (2335A_0093)
what about with adults (2335A_0094)
i think they can do anything about (2335A_0095)
crime yeah well the major problem with that as the jails are overcrowded (2335A_0100)
yeah (2335A_0109)
yeah (2335A_0112)
yeah (2335A_0115)
i mean seriously (2335A_0116)
put the people to work (2335A_0118)
yeah (2335A_0120)
 yeah yeah (2335A_0122)
yeah (2335A_0128)
wow (2335A_0131)
yeah (2335A_0133)
yeah (2335A_0135)
you still have to punish yeah yeah (2335A_0136)
that's (2335A_0138)
that's (2335A_0140)
yeah (2335A_0141)
yeah (2335A_0144)
and they're and they're still they can provide for society (2335A_0145)
whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society (2335A_0146)
yeah that's true (2335A_0153)
nah (2335A_0156)
i don't think so either (2335A_0157)
yeah (2335A_0160)
and then keep taking more money from us (2335A_0162)
people and (2335A_0164)
and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it (2335A_0165)
might as well so (2335A_0167)
and i don't have to pay taxes on it (2335A_0168)
that have (2335A_0177)
yeah (2335A_0179)
yeah (2335A_0181)
yeah (2335A_0185)
yeah (2335A_0188)
uh-huh (2335A_0190)
i'm not counting on it (2335A_0192)
yeah (2335A_0195)
  yeah (2335A_0199)
yeah (2335A_0202)
i'm in raleigh north carolina (2335A_0207)
hi where are you from (2335A_0210)
okay (2335A_0212)
 man (2335A_0214)
yeah (2335A_0220)
wow (2335A_0224)
why did they do in the freezer (2335A_0226)
yeah (2335A_0229)
that's awful (2335A_0233)
yeah (2335A_0234)
he still gets i'm in raleigh (2335A_0235)
not not too often real bad ones (2335A_0236)
yeah (2335A_0239)
i don't think there's any way whether isn't going to be crying (2335A_0242)
yeah (2335A_0249)
yeah (2335A_0254)
yeah (2335A_0257)
yeah  (2335A_0260)
in fact drug dealer (2335A_0263)
yeah (2335A_0265)
wow (2335A_0269)
yeah (2335A_0278)
yeah (2335A_0281)
yeah (2335A_0285)
kind of in the same same kind of deal townhouse in the neighborhood (2335A_0286)
pretty nice (2335A_0288)
yeah (2335A_0294)
yeah (2335A_0297)
yeah (2335A_0299)
nice i'm too scared to do anything (2335A_0300)
yeah (2335A_0303)
alright (2335A_0304)
listen i gotta go (2335A_0305)
good talking to you (2335A_0307)
alright (2335A_0309)
hello (2335A_0311)
so what do you think (2335B_0000)
yeah (2335B_0006)
what about (2335B_0011)
i agree with the upper lower level you know (2335B_0012)
because that's low esteem for themselves (2335B_0014)
plus there was nobody for them to look up to (2335B_0015)
but i also blame somebody on parents (2335B_0017)
because parents aren't parents (2335B_0019)
because i remember even when i was growing up (2335B_0021)
i'm thirty five (2335B_0022)
i remember when i was growing up (2335B_0024)
i had friends (2335B_0025)
they used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff (2335B_0026)
my mother warned as it was like okay what's your friends do (2335B_0027)
if you do it then that was it (2335B_0028)
i mean i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother didn't from from anybody else (2335B_0030)
and i think that's the basic if they have no morals anymore (2335B_0033)
so they don't care (2335B_0036)
so (2335B_0038)
but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know (2335B_0041)
can't make parents be parents (2335B_0043)
you know (2335B_0046)
i guess if you gave the gave them jobs (2335B_0048)
that that's another problem when the united states (2335B_0049)
there's no jobs anymore but (2335B_0050)
that (2335B_0052)
that'll work to a point (2335B_0055)
well that'll work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway (2335B_0057)
okay what'd you do to them (2335B_0058)
you know (2335B_0060)
so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid is being in you know (2335B_0061)
because  a child can get into anything (2335B_0063)
i don't care how good you (2335B_0065)
even at least one time (2335B_0067)
an avid the repeated thing (2335B_0068)
this child in june (2335B_0069)
well and all that to me yeah both of them (2335B_0070)
does that mean she's still not doing what she's supposed to do (2335B_0072)
cause i just watched it on tv one night on them  twenty twenty forty eight hours one of the shows what his boy had been stealing cars (2335B_0073)
i don't know if you've seen that (2335B_0077)
they was to go it was a little gang of stealing cars you know (2335B_0080)
and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there (2335B_0085)
now they're going to take me away from you (2335B_0086)
i mean she was warned (2335B_0087)
but see but i think sometimes it's a little late (2335B_0089)
you know (2335B_0091)
but i'm sure there's something can be done (2335B_0092)
yeah (2335B_0096)
start prosecuting they (2335B_0097)
but a really good and instead of having a revolving door and the damn court system (2335B_0098)
well they should start with the (2335B_0101)
if they would get rid of (2335B_0102)
seemed to me i know there's a lot about court that people don't (2335B_0103)
there's more people in jail right now for child support okay then there are for people doing drugs (2335B_0104)
take all their little misdemeanor people (2335B_0108)
let 'em go (2335B_0110)
let 'em go (2335B_0111)
you know give them a fine whatever (2335B_0113)
make 'em do civic duty whatever (2335B_0114)
hi i'm susan (2335B_0117)
i call 'em all foods idiots whatever (2335B_0119)
the rock stars put all them in there (2335B_0121)
you know the murderers the drug dealers to use it put 'em all in (2335B_0123)
yeah (2335B_0124)
and then all the normal people go (2335B_0127)
you know 'cause okay (2335B_0129)
right a bad check you go to jail right (2335B_0130)
letting people go (2335B_0132)
not let them go and get out of it (2335B_0134)
let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is (2335B_0137)
but don't put them in jail because they're not hard and criminals (2335B_0143)
so (2335B_0148)
unbelievable they got (2335B_0150)
i think the united states has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else (2335B_0151)
now how they going to fix it i don't know (2335B_0154)
no i don't think there is a very solution (2335B_0155)
because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the poll is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it (2335B_0159)
and he'd have to work extra hard just to make ends meet (2335B_0161)
yeah (2335B_0166)
that's it (2335B_0169)
so you know they i i know that it's bad but you know just like texas now (2335B_0171)
they could have had a lottery (2335B_0173)
they don't want a lottery (2335B_0174)
why not (2335B_0175)
i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar or two or three dollars whatever i'm paying you know a week or whatever and never see any of that money then they have them take a portion of my paycheck (2335B_0176)
you know they take (2335B_0182)
uncle sam takes his (2335B_0183)
the social security which probably won't be here when i get that old you know (2335B_0184)
because we're paying for social security there now (2335B_0187)
who's going to pay for my (2335B_0189)
yeah  but it's it's (2335B_0191)
nah (2335B_0193)
you don't count on social security (2335B_0194)
that's what i'm saying (2335B_0197)
they need to do something else (2335B_0198)
yeah (2335B_0200)
crime was going to go up as long as the economy stays down (2335B_0201)
he's going to get worse (2335B_0203)
that's just like last night they killed them people in that store (2335B_0205)
where are you at (2335B_0206)
no wonder you know whatever they killed (2335B_0209)
i'm in dallas (2335B_0211)
last night they killed   four people in a chain food (2335B_0213)
killed him (2335B_0215)
well it was to store side by side (2335B_0216)
one was a store and one was like a a fast food place (2335B_0218)
chicken or something i don't know (2335B_0219)
anyway they raped the women beat 'em all up including the women (2335B_0221)
they just beat him (2335B_0222)
why was you know dumb (2335B_0225)
you know why didn't they just (2335B_0227)
if they was going to like just lock 'em in the freezer take the money you know (2335B_0228)
they didn't have to kill them or rape 'em or anything (2335B_0230)
it's just getting really ridiculous down here (2335B_0240)
i wish i could move somewhere where it is you know you gotta like in the country (2335B_0241)
well i think if it's (2335B_0243)
the town is smaller (2335B_0244)
everybody knows everybody (2335B_0246)
it's harder to come in there and do something (2335B_0248)
and and see that's another thing (2335B_0252)
neighborhoods are neighborhoods anymore (2335B_0253)
nobody next door to (2335B_0255)
you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that (2335B_0256)
it's just  you know (2335B_0258)
cause i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers (2335B_0259)
and you didn't even (2335B_0261)
what the manager manager won't even do anything (2335B_0262)
you don't (2335B_0266)
and so i moved (2335B_0267)
because i moved the day probably a week after one in apartments blew up (2335B_0268)
and this is like across the street (2335B_0271)
this is a nice part of town (2335B_0272)
and then across the street one of the apartments blew up 'cause they were having that making that  crack stuff (2335B_0274)
and then the other time i saw the cops breakdown somebody's apartment around the corner (2335B_0276)
as i see this is it (2335B_0277)
that's it (2335B_0279)
and i moved (2335B_0280)
and you know now i live in like a a neighborhood in a townhouse (2335B_0282)
but it's nice (2335B_0283)
you know (2335B_0284)
but (2335B_0287)
i don't know how they can live in a neighborhood or apartment complex (2335B_0289)
that would have wrestling is wrong you know (2335B_0290)
i don't they don't rent to them (2335B_0293)
well written totally victim 'cause they drug test (2335B_0295)
put it on the least (2335B_0296)
if you do drugs you can't live here (2335B_0298)
that's it (2335B_0302)
well all righty (2335B_0306)
and i thank you (2335B_0308)
bye bye (2335B_0310)
well i don't know (2434A_0001)
i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to the radio and and watch tv about the different  things that are happening (2434A_0002)
 i'm against it (2434A_0003)
but on the same token  i went out and purchased the gun just because i wanted the right to do that (2434A_0004)
so i i have a rifle in the house (2434A_0006)
 the ammunition is probably sold i'm afraid to use it (2434A_0007)
but  i bought it for a tiger practicing and  and also because i wanted a weapon (2434A_0008)
how do you feel about it (2434A_0009)
well up up in new england where i'm from  you had to get a permit before you could buy any immediate and ammunition (2434A_0024)
and i thought that was really good (2434A_0025)
i think they (2434A_0026)
takes two weeks for that system to process  your request for  not as a gun permits but but to buy ammunition (2434A_0028)
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that (2434A_0029)
yeah  (2434A_0031)
i i i agree (2434A_0037)
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is  to to stop the impulse from  buying it quickly and and  maybe putting a week's waiting period or something (2434A_0040)
but if someone's really determined to to pick up fire   you can pick it up any place (2434A_0043)
and it can get them really cheap (2434A_0046)
how long was the waiting period (2434A_0053)
i wasn't too too bad (2434A_0056)
because if you're going to go buy something  of that nature i think if you're going to have some ideas to what you're going to do with (2434A_0059)
you're not going to react quickly (2434A_0060)
in other words you know you have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot at the next day (2434A_0061)
yeah (2434A_0065)
i do too  because it doesn't make any difference   whether it's a pistol or a shut down i suppose (2434A_0066)
go through the same kinda job (2434A_0067)
 yeah (2434A_0069)
i suppose (2434A_0070)
i never got shot with either one (2434A_0071)
but i don't know  (2434A_0072)
i think he could recover from a pier so but not from a shock (2434A_0073)
yeah (2434A_0077)
i've got a  manual single shot (2434A_0086)
and i guess it doesn't have any any automatically just do it (2434A_0087)
the further away i get the the  why did the shot yet from the target (2434A_0088)
and the closer that i got the tide of that again (2434A_0091)
got a hell of a kick to it (2434A_0092)
do you belong to a gun club or are you (2434A_0102)
no kidding (2434A_0108)
yeah well the the  clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive (2434A_0112)
but  it's well worth it (2434A_0113)
you can go down and shoot up against the sandbags targets and have a competition (2434A_0114)
 i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire (2434A_0115)
 there's an annual membership see  that's that's fairly high (2434A_0116)
plus there's an issue initiation feed that you have to pay because the first time a a member (2434A_0117)
so the whole process can cost you a hundred and fifty dollars just to join the club (2434A_0119)
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition a tournaments that you would join in (2434A_0120)
i think that the gun clubs survey useful purpose (2434A_0128)
in fact i'd like to see some how they tie the legislation in so not only when you buy a weapon you have to  show that you've gone through school or gone to some class to know how to handle that (2434A_0129)
and you know it it (2434A_0134)
even  after you what your nine days if you don't know how to handle it was like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive (2434A_0135)
give them a license because he waited nine days (2434A_0136)
he could you could not only   shoot themselves (2434A_0140)
they could you could  mishandles the weapon leave it at home and let a child good at it (2434A_0141)
i was fortunate (2434A_0147)
you could have said something else (2434A_0148)
wow (2434A_0151)
i'm about  private citizens selling weapons (2434A_0159)
like if you wanted to sell you a pistol to me (2434A_0160)
 how do you feel about that (2434A_0161)
they believe they ought to be legislation guiding the  (2434A_0162)
or do you believe that you want to be able to sell your system  because you won't it (2434A_0163)
yeah (2434A_0170)
but it isn't there a way to  the d register yourself after you register (2434A_0171)
because i have (2434A_0176)
yeah (2434A_0181)
as a registered (2434A_0182)
the  the rifles and i've got is not registered (2434A_0185)
and  i don't know why i never understood it (2434A_0187)
but the  (2434A_0188)
 i i think it's it's voluntary (2434A_0190)
the  (2434A_0191)
yeah (2434A_0194)
yeah (2434A_0200)
i guess that could happen (2434A_0201)
it's just like the  the social security system (2434A_0202)
once they  they gave everybody a number (2434A_0203)
and now they're making you   get one at at birth (2434A_0204)
and once they have your number they have you know your identification (2434A_0206)
if you try to do anything  like  not identify yourself to the government they know who you are (2434A_0209)
that's true (2434A_0212)
and so (2434A_0219)
you were talking about   what the federal government knows about people (2434A_0220)
they probably do (2434A_0225)
yeah (2434A_0232)
you find it difficult picking up by guns that that are not registered (2434A_0236)
yeah (2434A_0238)
i don't either (2434A_0239)
i can i can buy some  today if i wanted to (2434A_0240)
just you know put up the money (2434A_0241)
yeah (2434A_0251)
and there's there's no waiting period and  (2434A_0254)
to sell the (2434A_0261)
yeah (2434A_0263)
and i think the federal government is  is really far away from a  control (2434A_0265)
i don't believe in  (2434A_0266)
i should probably say control (2434A_0267)
regulation (2434A_0268)
control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government the (2434A_0269)
 but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons (2434A_0270)
yeah (2434A_0274)
unfortunately we  we vote for the the people who spend the money (2434A_0276)
so i can't complain too much (2434A_0277)
well what would you say your opinion is on gun control (2434B_0000)
well i think  down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on hang on (2434B_0010)
and i think they need that (2434B_0012)
 i do have a i have a pistol (2434B_0013)
it's a little twenty two (2434B_0014)
and i have a twenty two or twelve guys shocked (2434B_0015)
and you know i do like to have my guts (2434B_0017)
 i don't know if i'll ever use it (2434B_0019)
like you my bullets to my little pistols probably  about three years old (2434B_0020)
 my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two (2434B_0021)
but  i like to have 'em where handy (2434B_0023)
i've never heard of anything like that (2434B_0030)
that would be nice (2434B_0032)
but now (2434B_0033)
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other (2434B_0036)
yeah (2434B_0044)
i know (2434B_0047)
i  i had to wait in period on my postal 'cause i was down in  tennessee and  they had a waiting period (2434B_0048)
nah we bought it there (2434B_0051)
yeah (2434B_0052)
about nine days (2434B_0054)
uh-huh (2434B_0057)
yeah (2434B_0058)
somebody wants to do that (2434B_0063)
i at times i think they oughta have a waiting period on all firearms (2434B_0064)
shot gun hurts force in a pistol does (2434B_0068)
shotguns got too much of a spread (2434B_0075)
or at least ours does (2434B_0076)
 it (2434B_0079)
have a little  thing on the bottom of it on top of the barrel where you at u turn it (2434B_0080)
you can make it either tight or loses loose can get (2434B_0083)
and the spread changes (2434B_0085)
yeah (2434B_0089)
yeah (2434B_0093)
my husband had a  a police done at one time (2434B_0094)
and i shot that thing one time (2434B_0095)
almost knocked me down (2434B_0096)
just (2434B_0098)
i don't i forget (2434B_0099)
i think it was a three fifty seven (2434B_0100)
i'm not sure (2434B_0101)
he belong to one a while back (2434B_0103)
 since (2434B_0104)
we've only been here in texas for about a year (2434B_0105)
 we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice (2434B_0107)
i'd love to get used to that shocked (2434B_0110)
tried to his pistol for that shot gun (2434B_0111)
yeah (2434B_0121)
well that's what  my husband (2434B_0122)
when he was in it gun club always done that (2434B_0123)
it you know (2434B_0124)
he went mostly just the  shoot it paper targets (2434B_0125)
 but you know they use speed and accuracy and all that (2434B_0127)
that's a good (2434B_0130)
i've never thought of that (2434B_0131)
that's a good point (2434B_0133)
yeah (2434B_0137)
uh-huh (2434B_0138)
yeah you could not you know  (2434B_0139)
 wait i was living on a navy base down in memphis (2434B_0143)
and  this one guy decided to play lonesome cowboy or something (2434B_0144)
he was torturing his gun around that shot himself in his foot (2434B_0145)
well he went tunnel and down the steps along with shoot in his foot almost off (2434B_0149)
they broke his leg and collarbone and couple of other things which or being mr cowboy (2434B_0150)
i can't remember what the term was going around (2434B_0155)
about forty five years ago (2434B_0156)
now the i guess that would be a good idea (2434B_0158)
 that's a hard one because we did that (2434B_0166)
but  i think there ought to be some role against us (2434B_0167)
 you know (2434B_0168)
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because it's that guns registered to them when somebody else she uses it in something of cops that don't want to come to you (2434B_0169)
have no idea (2434B_0174)
i've only had one (2434B_0175)
and i've kept it you know  the one guy that was in my name (2434B_0178)
yeah (2434B_0183)
i don't think you have to register shocked (2434B_0189)
well see  my husband has a thing (2434B_0192)
if they go to  regulating   ban and guns private citizens (2434B_0193)
my kid is jumping on me (2434B_0196)
can't hardly talk (2434B_0197)
 my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns (2434B_0199)
yeah (2434B_0207)
everything about too (2434B_0211)
uh-huh (2434B_0213)
no i know from how much money you make a week to  probably your  (2434B_0214)
my kid is banging (2434B_0215)
same with  (2434B_0216)
 i've lost my train of thought (2434B_0217)
i'm sorry (2434B_0218)
 the (2434B_0221)
yeah (2434B_0223)
they probably know everything from half time what time we go to the bathroom (2434B_0224)
that's a little bit extreme (2434B_0227)
but i could know anything and everything about you (2434B_0228)
and  i'd like to have my gun (2434B_0229)
if they go to band in banning them i'd lose my gun (2434B_0230)
but we wouldn't lose our our  shot gun (2434B_0231)
and  we're wanting to get a couple more that no one knows about (2434B_0233)
but i don't i don't  (2434B_0235)
no (2434B_0237)
yeah (2434B_0242)
yeah (2434B_0245)
well you can look in the  (2434B_0246)
we got the thing down here called a shopper (2434B_0247)
it's   it's a it's a bargain thing (2434B_0249)
 you go and you know always see guns and they're five the seven guns a day (2434B_0250)
it comes out every tuesday (2434B_0253)
none whatsoever (2434B_0256)
you call (2434B_0258)
we sold her refrigerator through it (2434B_0259)
and it took us all of twelve hours (2434B_0260)
yeah (2434B_0262)
you know and i'm sure a big even less for somebody with a gun (2434B_0264)
i agree with you there (2434B_0272)
i do have too much control over his already (2434B_0273)
 we can look at a pay check and see how much control it has (2434B_0275)
yeah (2434B_0278)
i guess (2434B_0279)
i don't know (2434B_0280)
yeah (2434B_0281)
well i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself (2441A_0000)
but   i don't know if it's they're proposal or ones being seriously kicked around (2441A_0001)
i've i've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids out to do a student  primarily in the military (2441A_0005)
hello (2441A_0018)
yeah   yeah a lot yeah (2441A_0019)
well you take israel (2441A_0020)
i mean everybody does (2441A_0022)
i don't think it's bad idea (2441A_0024)
teachers teachers a lot (2441A_0025)
i went in the service when i was eighteen and  stayed in for ten years (2441A_0026)
yeah (2441A_0030)
 did a lot of growing up (2441A_0031)
yeah (2441A_0035)
yeah (2441A_0041)
do it himself (2441A_0046)
yeah well my parents wanted to send me to college (2441A_0050)
and i was dead set against it (2441A_0051)
you know i had wander last you know (2441A_0053)
and i got in (2441A_0055)
after after wasting the first six years  partying and everything else i decided   time settle down and do something (2441A_0056)
so i started to work on my education (2441A_0057)
of course my job was such that i didn't i couldn't do it as much as i wanted (2441A_0059)
and still i ended up going to semesters when i got out just to get my degree (2441A_0061)
that have been in school ever since (2441A_0063)
yeah (2441A_0065)
i guess (2441A_0066)
yeah (2441A_0071)
if you don't like (2441A_0072)
sure (2441A_0074)
exactly (2441A_0076)
 yeah (2441A_0078)
absolutely (2441A_0079)
all these all the all this money that were throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients (2441A_0084)
and if they're able bodied people i don't see any problem at all have them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them round the old folks places and let 'em cut the yards and paint the houses (2441A_0085)
sure (2441A_0090)
sure (2441A_0091)
uh-huh (2441A_0093)
get something out of that money (2441A_0094)
yeah (2441A_0096)
yeah (2441A_0097)
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division (2441A_0101)
his soul jobs just tracking down people who are getting benefits and able bodied (2441A_0102)
yeah (2441A_0105)
and he had all kinds of horror stories (2441A_0106)
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks (2441A_0107)
and back back in those days they also used to give you a booklets good for  clothing and gas and things like this (2441A_0108)
and they get all this stuff together shouldn't have poker games you know (2441A_0110)
and i'm i just i have a hard time dealing with that (2441A_0113)
 yeah (2441A_0115)
yeah (2441A_0118)
yeah (2441A_0119)
you think about you think about the bureaucracy between the money in the recipient (2441A_0120)
and and there's there's probably there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy (2441A_0123)
you know it's it's it's totally ridiculous (2441A_0126)
 i  started out when i first got in graduate school (2441A_0127)
i was going into a public administration (2441A_0128)
and quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any (2441A_0129)
yeah (2441A_0131)
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at (2441A_0132)
you sit there (2441A_0134)
when you're writing a budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need (2441A_0135)
well you need x number of dollars for the recipient (2441A_0136)
but you need x number of dollars to administer the program (2441A_0137)
this is ridiculous (2441A_0138)
this is ridiculous (2441A_0140)
it is (2441A_0142)
it's pathetic (2441A_0143)
i mean there's got to be a different way (2441A_0144)
there's got to be a better way (2441A_0145)
but it'll never happen (2441A_0146)
i mean these these people out here getting that money or our big voting blocks (2441A_0147)
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as  (2441A_0154)
and i would limited strictly to something like  tuition assistance (2441A_0155)
 given incentive (2441A_0157)
yeah (2441A_0159)
something something that's going to help them along the way (2441A_0160)
sure (2441A_0162)
i mean (2441A_0163)
well this (2441A_0165)
i mean i mean look at look at the statistics (2441A_0166)
it's sad (2441A_0169)
and five americans can't read (2441A_0170)
are adults that is can't even read (2441A_0172)
and and we've got the lowest rights of civilized countries and science and math (2441A_0173)
i mean what are we what are we become (2441A_0175)
becoming a service country (2441A_0176)
yeah (2441A_0178)
we were in industrial giants (2441A_0179)
and now we're not we're not going to do it because everybody is is beat misses the game (2441A_0180)
we taught them how to do it (2441A_0181)
and they they did it better than we do (2441A_0182)
simple as (2441A_0185)
yeah (2441A_0187)
simple as (2441A_0188)
yeah (2441A_0192)
terrible for us (2441A_0193)
yeah (2441A_0195)
yeah (2441A_0197)
and and it can be good for them to (2441A_0198)
i mean even the the greedy kids that we've got now (2441A_0201)
yeah yeah i know (2441A_0204)
no (2441A_0206)
well you know you know you know why they do it so they can get 'em out of the house (2441A_0209)
yeah (2441A_0211)
that's that's my other complain (2441A_0212)
parents aren't parents anymore (2441A_0213)
yeah (2441A_0216)
one or the other subjects do you think the public school systems are in trouble (2441A_0217)
well as a substitute teacher for a year i can i can say yes (2441A_0219)
 yeah (2441A_0226)
yeah (2441A_0231)
exactly (2441A_0233)
well in a way it is (2441A_0237)
but but you have to look out for yourself (2441A_0238)
and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers (2441A_0243)
gosh (2441A_0246)
i mean (2441A_0247)
yeah (2441A_0250)
yeah (2441A_0251)
they do an absolutely necessary job (2441A_0252)
i mean i i i have a great deal admiration for these people who can go out there and do that (2441A_0253)
 but i mean there there's a there's a sense of priorities here too (2441A_0255)
you know we need (2441A_0257)
what's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids (2441A_0258)
yeah (2441A_0261)
sure (2441A_0263)
i mean ones and poor (2441A_0265)
on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man new york city starts out of twenty six thousand dollars (2441A_0266)
well i'll bet you they're a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job thirteen thousand dollars a year (2441A_0268)
yeah  i mean my other pet peeves unions (2441A_0270)
you know it's just it's it's ridiculous the way unions have gone (2441A_0273)
i mean there there was a time when unions were needed (2441A_0274)
and they serve the good function (2441A_0276)
but but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated (2441A_0277)
and they're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure (2441A_0278)
yeah (2441A_0289)
sure (2441A_0291)
and that and that and and that's that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country (2441A_0292)
so many times i mean you had the  the cold minors and steel workers going at the same time (2441A_0296)
and  well that took care of that industry (2441A_0297)
now and then and and i'll tell you (2441A_0299)
detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country (2441A_0300)
yeah (2441A_0302)
i mean you know we've never caught up (2441A_0303)
but i don't think we ever will (2441A_0304)
 yeah (2441A_0306)
i mean here it is (2441A_0307)
we've got we've got to go into partnership with the japanese the bill cars (2441A_0308)
and they only did it because they i guess they're embarrassed that they're so good at it (2441A_0310)
gosh (2441A_0314)
yeah (2441A_0315)
back to the original subject (2441A_0316)
i think i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service (2441A_0318)
i don't care what kind it is (2441A_0319)
yeah (2441A_0321)
and pride themselves too (2441A_0322)
like anything i mean you could organize something just within your community you know saying the same old thing (2441A_0324)
sure (2441A_0330)
i think they ought to take them and and i don't know it just has sort of like a a a a manpower pool and say okay look (2441A_0333)
we need some (2441A_0334)
nope (2441B_0002)
i don't either (2441B_0003)
yeah (2441B_0006)
most countries are part of that (2441B_0008)
they you know they have  it mandatory for for that  at least the young men (2441B_0009)
i don't know was young (2441B_0015)
they have to sort of the military too (2441B_0016)
yeah (2441B_0023)
right (2441B_0029)
i bet (2441B_0032)
yeah i do (2441B_0034)
my father had been in the milk (2441B_0037)
i didn't do it myself (2441B_0038)
and my father had (2441B_0039)
that's  hi put themselves through school basically (2441B_0040)
he came from a poor immigrant family (2441B_0042)
he didn't have a chance to  you know that kind of weather (2441B_0043)
that it was a wealthy (2441B_0044)
so he had to do something to put themselves through school (2441B_0045)
and he did he did (2441B_0048)
and he was very successful (2441B_0049)
yeah (2441B_0054)
yeah (2441B_0058)
that's pretty good (2441B_0062)
that's good (2441B_0064)
yeah (2441B_0067)
that's (2441B_0068)
i don't know (2441B_0069)
there's other kinds of service for the country that could be done you know (2441B_0070)
 working in the national parks  working clean up the road sides (2441B_0073)
i mean there's lots of i mean i've always felt that  people are on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time not not all the time because that that takes away from their opportunity look for a job but at least another time to look forward to  go out and clean up the roads and (2441B_0077)
i mean (2441B_0083)
yeah (2441B_0086)
yeah (2441B_0088)
we've learned service to other people in this country (2441B_0089)
something kind of a benefit (2441B_0095)
i mean (2441B_0098)
yeah (2441B_0104)
yeah yeah (2441B_0109)
yeah (2441B_0111)
what i hear one time of things on paul harvey is   radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was be given directly to the people without all the middle people and the government each person where was he like forty five thousand dollars (2441B_0114)
i mean i was astounded (2441B_0116)
i don't even make that (2441B_0117)
yeah (2441B_0121)
and they're taking that away (2441B_0122)
yeah (2441B_0124)
no doubt (2441B_0125)
right (2441B_0130)
yeah (2441B_0133)
yeah (2441B_0139)
it's sad (2441B_0141)
yeah (2441B_0148)
yeah (2441B_0150)
what what happened  if if the federal required young people to do (2441B_0151)
well should they get in return i wonder (2441B_0152)
like  (2441B_0153)
yeah (2441B_0156)
educational vocational training or something (2441B_0158)
and they'll help the country eventually too because rather than having much better educated people we can have educated (2441B_0161)
it's only going to help (2441B_0167)
yeah (2441B_0171)
yeah (2441B_0174)
 as opposed to what we were twenty years ago (2441B_0177)
yeah (2441B_0183)
because they had the ambition i guess (2441B_0186)
and that (2441B_0189)
which is good for them (2441B_0190)
on their hand we kinda lose out (2441B_0191)
i think that if  young people have cirrhosis of the country might give them more ambition 'cause it you know that they learn that serving other people as a as a good thing (2441B_0194)
yeah (2441B_0199)
 yeah (2441B_0200)
 gosh i go to the mall (2441B_0202)
and you see you know fourteen year old kid flying money 'cause their parents giving money to go down and play video games all night (2441B_0203)
for what (2441B_0205)
give me the money (2441B_0207)
i'll teach some good (2441B_0208)
yeah (2441B_0210)
yeah (2441B_0214)
they they really with their parents (2441B_0215)
yeah (2441B_0218)
yeah (2441B_0220)
i mean i talk with somebody else about that on the other time (2441B_0221)
you know when i was in grad school work on my master's degree  in math i was  teaching as part of my part of the program (2441B_0222)
and i just love teaching (2441B_0223)
that was a lot of i was a part of the most fun i had (2441B_0224)
and  it it helped me out because i learned things and learn how to do things differently (2441B_0225)
and when  when i can kinda get out of school i thought boy like (2441B_0229)
but you know for for what (2441B_0230)
you know i don't want to live in a little one bedroom part of the rest of my life (2441B_0232)
that's a sad thing (2441B_0234)
that's kind of selfish on my part (2441B_0235)
and i admit that (2441B_0236)
yeah (2441B_0239)
that's right (2441B_0240)
that's wrong (2441B_0244)
i'm not saying the guardsmen should be paid less (2441B_0248)
teachers should be paid more (2441B_0249)
yeah (2441B_0254)
yeah (2441B_0256)
yeah (2441B_0259)
they both have their place (2441B_0260)
but but you know when it gets right down to it (2441B_0264)
that's pretty good (2441B_0267)
yeah (2441B_0269)
yeah (2441B_0271)
yeah  yeah (2441B_0272)
and they started to function (2441B_0275)
yeah and they're only there the company my dad worked for  the people that went on a strike against against the  management (2441B_0279)
 it was a steel manufacturing place (2441B_0280)
and they  (2441B_0281)
there's a time when  important still wasn't so cheap (2441B_0282)
and they were having a hard time (2441B_0283)
and they told us drivers or look (2441B_0284)
we need you to come back and get this stuff done (2441B_0285)
or else we're going to be out of business (2441B_0286)
and they wouldn't come back (2441B_0287)
so they went bankrupt (2441B_0288)
and and they all lost their jobs (2441B_0290)
and it's like you know (2441B_0293)
yeah (2441B_0295)
yeah i took care of that industry that's right (2441B_0298)
and they're trying to do that now with the imports (2441B_0301)
it'd be a tough road though yeah we've got we've got to go into partnership with the japanese cars yeah and they only did it because they i guess they're embarrassed (2441B_0305)
yeah (2441B_0309)
that's about right (2441B_0313)
teach them teaches them  pride in their country (2441B_0320)
that's right (2441B_0323)
yeah (2441B_0325)
that's right (2441B_0328)
that's it that's like eagle scout (2441B_0329)
they have something like that and that's a great idea (2441B_0332)
okay (2461A_0000)
we're going to talk about the public school system okay what's wrong with it and  if anything's wrong with it and what we can do about it should be done about it (2461A_0001)
yeah (2461A_0006)
yeah (2461A_0008)
it's amazing  (2461A_0009)
i've always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean right to be doing what they're doing  (2461A_0010)
when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching (2461A_0013)
teaching part time (2461A_0014)
and i really enjoy that (2461A_0015)
but i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high (2461A_0016)
just you know (2461A_0017)
yeah (2461A_0022)
they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week (2461A_0023)
i'm sure they got a grade papers and get ready (2461A_0024)
and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people are being paid (2461A_0027)
they were paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what (2461A_0030)
yeah (2461A_0033)
yeah (2461A_0038)
 do you have little kids or what (2461A_0040)
yeah (2461A_0046)
yeah (2461A_0047)
and i have a three year old almost four and a and a two year old (2461A_0048)
although we're looking at the older one going to school next year and not not well not this coming fall but you after that (2461A_0050)
so it's getting close yeah (2461A_0053)
and we're going to kindergarten (2461A_0054)
so you know we're we're thinking about that (2461A_0057)
without going to be like (2461A_0058)
i got to be taught nothing (2461A_0059)
going to be taught (2461A_0060)
we're going to we're going to be involved in our child to the case (2461A_0061)
we're going to be teaching them what we can at home of course right 'cause  i guess we don't trust the school systems which is really sad  (2461A_0062)
but but if it doesn't start homeless not going to go anywhere right (2461A_0065)
and we're going to try to teach them good values 'cause you know when when they get the upper level school and they start teaching way if you can play football or basketball that's what's important now if you can read or write or or or set some science (2461A_0071)
i mean give me a break (2461A_0074)
that's that's that's bogus (2461A_0075)
yeah (2461A_0079)
dallas  school district just recently got advice status because they're low quality school (2461A_0081)
i couldn't believe that (2461A_0083)
yeah (2461A_0087)
yeah (2461A_0090)
we talked about before about the school funding (2461A_0091)
i think it was only going to be one solution to school funding which i don't think it would be necessarily the best (2461A_0092)
what was going to have to happen is going out to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kid (2461A_0093)
i don't where they're going to fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit (2461A_0094)
 yeah (2461A_0099)
yeah (2461A_0103)
and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition (2461A_0104)
works it causes it'll work down below (2461A_0105)
and you know that's going to that's going to affect people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do (2461A_0107)
but it'll be hard for those that people haven't school 'cause they have to pay out even more (2461A_0108)
 yeah (2461A_0111)
that's right (2461A_0113)
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything (2461A_0115)
good grief (2461A_0116)
now that's that's just unbelievable to me i can't believe that (2461A_0119)
i mean when i was in junior high and high school i never have (2461A_0120)
never heard about that (2461A_0121)
yeah (2461A_0124)
and now you know what we have now (2461A_0125)
got kids that get together you know   magnum gun in school (2461A_0126)
good grief (2461A_0127)
i mean i i'd be afraid to be in school i mean teaching or even at a being a student (2461A_0129)
what's it going to be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school (2461A_0130)
what what's going to happen (2461A_0131)
i mean i i'm afraid for him to go (2461A_0132)
and you can't hold them back (2461A_0135)
yeah (2461A_0139)
type of what it was when i was growing up (2461A_0140)
yeah (2461A_0141)
well i was i graduate high school in nineteen seventy nine (2461A_0142)
 it was what twelve years ago i guess (2461A_0145)
so you know it's a lot different now (2461A_0147)
what's going to be like another twelve years and my oldest son is in high school (2461A_0148)
i'm pretty even think about it (2461A_0151)
that's all you can do (2461A_0155)
you gotta you gotta be your child's best friend i guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of stand off (2461A_0158)
still got to be the best friend 'cause when they got problems who's he going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents exactly (2461A_0161)
and if they go to their friends doing drugs they're going to be in worse shape (2461A_0164)
and and the schools don't don't really encourage the stay away from that (2461A_0166)
the schools teach history and that we fought the civil war etc etc (2461A_0167)
they don't teach them goodbyes like drugs are bad (2461A_0168)
maybe i'm wrong because i haven't been that come and bomb them for a long time (2461A_0169)
right it just is amazing (2461A_0170)
teach 'em good values (2461A_0173)
of course i say this is a good value someone else is going to them and say  no (2461A_0177)
the aclu are going to get after him and have a law suit was going to take twenty years of resolve you know (2461A_0178)
yeah (2461A_0183)
and that's all you can do (2461A_0187)
that's right (2461A_0191)
well i got to be going (2461A_0192)
so  (2461A_0193)
nice talking to you too (2461A_0196)
okay (2461B_0002)
fantastic (2461B_0004)
well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is  about the  funding of the the school system right now (2461B_0005)
evidently  that's that's a big problem (2461B_0007)
right (2461B_0011)
 lord i mean yeah (2461B_0018)
you talk about stress in pressure (2461B_0019)
tell you what (2461B_0020)
it's a (2461B_0021)
right (2461B_0026)
exactly (2461B_0028)
and (2461B_0029)
that's right (2461B_0031)
and then they  put off you know just (2461B_0032)
but  i don't know (2461B_0034)
what gets me is i can't believe that congress  our our state legislature can't come up with  some kind of workable means to have fun for the school (2461B_0035)
you know it's  (2461B_0036)
i just don't understand that (2461B_0037)
no  (2461B_0041)
sure (2461B_0042)
my wife and i've just been married about two years (2461B_0043)
but i have a sister that's a a school teacher (2461B_0044)
and  (2461B_0045)
okay (2461B_0049)
okay (2461B_0051)
so it's getting close (2461B_0052)
right (2461B_0056)
right (2461B_0063)
exactly (2461B_0066)
right (2461B_0068)
that's true (2461B_0069)
exactly (2461B_0072)
right (2461B_0076)
right (2461B_0077)
and  you know one thing my wife now i've talked about it or a private schools you know whether   we would want to invest in in private schools as  growing up 'cause you know just in the dallas area  we're not real comfortable with  with the public schools (2461B_0078)
right (2461B_0082)
right (2461B_0084)
you know what that's one reason we bought a house here in plano (2461B_0085)
we were hoping you know well the school district's going to be good you know for resale value and so and so forth (2461B_0086)
but  i can definitely  see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age is going to be a definite concern (2461B_0089)
that's (2461B_0095)
yeah (2461B_0096)
and you know that's (2461B_0097)
texas right now or political suicide (2461B_0098)
i don't think politicians going to do that (2461B_0101)
so (2461B_0102)
right (2461B_0106)
exactly (2461B_0109)
and you know it's going to really hurt the the middle class  people i think 'cause  they're the ones that are all probably have to carry the brunt of the low (2461B_0110)
so  (2461B_0114)
yeah (2461B_0117)
that's that's just unbelievable to me you know (2461B_0118)
well yeah (2461B_0122)
when when you think about it you know (2461B_0123)
right (2461B_0128)
exactly (2461B_0133)
right (2461B_0134)
well no in (2461B_0136)
you want to encourage 'em you know to to be active and everything in school (2461B_0137)
but  you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is a it's a tough environment to be growing up in (2461B_0138)
okay (2461B_0144)
right (2461B_0146)
i try (2461B_0149)
that's right (2461B_0150)
yeah that is a scary thought (2461B_0152)
but  i don't know (2461B_0153)
i guess why you have to just  keeping  you know encouraging them and and   try to be open with them so that you can deal with problems as they come up (2461B_0154)
yeah (2461B_0156)
and (2461B_0157)
right (2461B_0159)
exactly (2461B_0162)
that's right (2461B_0165)
right (2461B_0171)
that's true (2461B_0174)
that's true (2461B_0175)
and  (2461B_0176)
right (2461B_0179)
when i think  you touched on it (2461B_0181)
gotta start him at the home (2461B_0182)
that's where they that's where they get the the deep rooted value (2461B_0185)
and  and that's about right (2461B_0186)
then you just have to hope and pray that that everything  works out works out okay (2461B_0189)
okay (2461B_0194)
hi appreciate golf (2461B_0195)
you too bye bye (2461B_0197)
hi wanda (2503A_0000)
how are you (2503A_0001)
i'm from new england (2503A_0004)
massachusetts (2503A_0005)
wow (2503A_0008)
quite a quite a long distance (2503A_0009)
you have any pets (2503A_0012)
how come you don't have any (2503A_0017)
tired of it (2503A_0018)
yeah (2503A_0021)
i've got a little doggy  that i've had quite a quite a long time (2503A_0024)
she just turned sixteen years old new year's eve (2503A_0025)
and  (2503A_0027)
i bet (2503A_0029)
she's    a poodle (2503A_0031)
 a toy poodle and she's (2503A_0032)
this is a little bigger than the (2503A_0039)
and  it's funny how  how i buy acquired this animal (2503A_0041)
when i was married my  ex wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she knew (2503A_0042)
the woman needed someone to babysit (2503A_0043)
and  this is what she had told the kids (2503A_0044)
and she even told me that (2503A_0045)
and after the two week period was up  she than informed me that the woman no longer wanted a little puppy in one of the no if we wanted to keep it (2503A_0046)
well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks is  you become you become attached to it (2503A_0047)
so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years (2503A_0051)
she spent a lot of company (2503A_0052)
she's  however getting a little (2503A_0053)
things are starting to fail (2503A_0054)
 i i live alone now (2503A_0055)
and she stays in the house all day while i go to war (2503A_0056)
and  she's been holding herself pretty well the  up until you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is (2503A_0057)
and  i find that little president on the floor sometimes when i come home (2503A_0058)
but she's she's usually pretty good (2503A_0059)
 well you might want to get yourself an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat (2503A_0079)
yeah (2503A_0089)
well my my personal preference as as a dog (2503A_0092)
i don't know that  that i'd ever want a cat (2503A_0093)
 i like cats (2503A_0094)
just wouldn't want to own (2503A_0095)
 they're not  they're they're affectionate (2503A_0096)
but (2503A_0099)
yeah (2503A_0100)
i don't know (2503A_0101)
can't seem to communicate with a cat like a can with my dog (2503A_0102)
yeah (2503A_0110)
right (2503A_0111)
that (2503A_0112)
you're supposed to appreciate them (2503A_0114)
well my my dog when i came home  when i come home and evenings she's my dog reach me at the door (2503A_0115)
i don't know that a cat would do that though (2503A_0116)
yeah (2503A_0121)
yeah (2503A_0126)
yeah (2503A_0127)
 i i think  in a worry about the each other pretty well because  she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too (2503A_0130)
yeah (2503A_0131)
i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose (2503A_0133)
which when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me (2503A_0134)
 and and you know some people might not believe that (2503A_0138)
but  but i do (2503A_0139)
like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours  because i was going out and she would  break something or rip off the capital to do something just to  to to let me know that she was unhappy with what they did (2503A_0142)
yeah (2503A_0144)
 yeah (2503A_0159)
the animal to have a way of talking (2503A_0160)
i i don't know that i'd  that i tried my dog and for the world (2503A_0163)
it was about two years ago she gets sick (2503A_0164)
i took it to the  to the vets because she wasn't eating and and  she wasn't able to jump (2503A_0165)
you know lost all their activity (2503A_0166)
and  she stayed there for one day (2503A_0167)
and the doctor called me up and said  she had a little white cell count and that  she wasn't she was dying and  suggested that i think it's who are working hotdog hospital animal hospital (2503A_0168)
so i took a suggestion (2503A_0169)
and i  took the dog to a hospital or a dog hospitals (2503A_0170)
and they said they'd keep it there for three days (2503A_0171)
well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in the sense of (2503A_0172)
it cost me over five hundred dollars (2503A_0173)
plus the the  the vet send me a bill for what he did (2503A_0175)
and  and then she recoup (2503A_0176)
she was okay for a couple of years (2503A_0177)
and then she got sick on me again (2503A_0178)
and i brought it to a different vet this time (2503A_0179)
i totally vet what medication i had given him and everything (2503A_0180)
and  he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave it to last (2503A_0181)
she was okay (2503A_0182)
she's been okay ever since (2503A_0183)
spend about two years now (2503A_0184)
yeah (2503A_0188)
well they see the problem is if if the if someone when he came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep a dog alive (2503A_0189)
but do you want to do (2503A_0190)
i probably would have had second thoughts (2503A_0191)
but what they what they do is is they say well it's going to cost you know twenty dollars protest and forty dollars for this (2503A_0194)
and and you know in a creeps up on (2503A_0195)
i don't know that  (2503A_0196)
you really you don't know what it's going to cost until it's all over (2503A_0197)
 they give you an example my mum had an elderly cat who  whoever evidently got older (2503A_0199)
and  the cat got sick (2503A_0200)
so she took the cat to the vet (2503A_0201)
and she had the cat there for two days (2503A_0202)
and then the cat died (2503A_0203)
so the doctor at called her up and said  your cat died (2503A_0204)
and you want me this is bill (2503A_0205)
and  by the way do you want me to to bury the cats (2503A_0206)
so it cost two or three hundred dollars  (2503A_0208)
and she didn't get the cat back (2503A_0209)
yeah (2503A_0210)
they had to pay for all the the medical  builds with the cat ran up plus the very expensive (2503A_0211)
and  you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good (2503A_0213)
so that was the kind of a surprise (2503A_0214)
at least (2503A_0218)
yeah (2503A_0221)
well even the you know (2503A_0222)
they they claim they did the best that they could (2503A_0223)
and then the cat died (2503A_0224)
it's (2503A_0225)
now i'm looking for another cat for them  (2503A_0227)
 i've got a little kitten  that's still  or just being born right now (2503A_0229)
so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over to  to my folks (2503A_0230)
yeah (2503A_0232)
i think it will (2503A_0233)
because they're both in their in their seventies in  the cat the although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns out to be a a pleasant experience for them (2503A_0234)
i think that they enjoy that (2503A_0235)
yeah (2503A_0237)
yeah (2503A_0239)
well same here (2503A_0242)
okay (2503A_0244)

yeah (2503B_0060)
well my my mother has one (2503B_0061)

the way my mom was president scout and it's it's just just for having a pet (2503B_0065)
you know having this dog (2503B_0066)

yeah (2503B_0078)
 yeah (2503B_0080)
well yeah (2503B_0081)
 i i typically am not a cat person (2503B_0082)
have a friend that  has on occasion  brought her cat over for me to keep for you know time to time (2503B_0084)
and this cat is like no other cat i've ever seen (2503B_0085)
and  would sleep on my chest you know (2503B_0086)
it's just it's just a great cat (2503B_0090)
but (2503B_0091)
 you don't own cats (2503B_0097)
yea (2503B_0103)
they they on you or or you know grant you with their presence (2503B_0104)
yeah (2503B_0117)
i used to have that that could read me better than any human being in my life (2503B_0118)
i can just walk in the door (2503B_0122)
and she knew whether to  sit quietly come up to me or did you just run and and not me (2503B_0123)
i mean she really good pick up on my mood  the way i walked in the door (2503B_0125)
uncanny (2503B_0129)
yeah (2503B_0132)
yeah (2503B_0135)
 sure (2503B_0140)
 absolutely (2503B_0141)
really (2503B_0143)
well i had that cat that i mentioned  (2503B_0146)
one morning you know the first thing you do you get up and you feed this gets up something and you make sure that it can get through it's litter box well (2503B_0147)
well i'm raising during the night the door was not quite wide net for it to get through (2503B_0148)
and  acts morning  my roommate got up and and  did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest (2503B_0151)
so it jumped up on my bed anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me i too i all the time it was doing (2503B_0153)
alright have i got your attention now (2503B_0158)
it did (2503B_0161)
i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day (2503B_0162)
ouch (2503B_0174)
 well that's great (2503B_0185)
it really is (2503B_0186)
i'm glad you he was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time (2503B_0187)
yeah (2503B_0192)
of course you would (2503B_0193)
 really (2503B_0215)
yeah (2503B_0216)
yeah (2503B_0219)
you kinda wonder what really (2503B_0220)
my goodness (2503B_0226)
well that that will make their day (2503B_0231)
only work initially (2503B_0236)
cats anyway you know (2503B_0238)
well listen (2503B_0240)
it's been a pleasure talking to you (2503B_0241)
and you take care (2503B_0243)
maybe we'll talk again (2503B_0247)
my (2503B_0250)
okay (2503B_0253)
yeah (2503B_0255)
one thing you know that i always think about when they think of public education (2632A_0002)
because i went through the public school system of boston (2632A_0003)
and  i always felt that i graduated high school (2632A_0005)
and i still didn't even i i i couldn't put together a map of the united states (2632A_0006)
you know what i mean (2632A_0008)
and yet i felt that i got a good education (2632A_0010)
and i did well in school (2632A_0011)
but you tell me to name you know five continents (2632A_0012)
and i couldn't do it (2632A_0013)
i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education (2632A_0016)
and that people are leaving school not even knowing some commonsense things (2632A_0018)
yeah (2632A_0024)
right (2632A_0028)
yeah (2632A_0030)
 did you go through a a public school system or private (2632A_0031)
did you notice a big difference (2632A_0035)
like in what sense (2632A_0038)
yeah (2632A_0045)
i work in a temporary agency (2632A_0046)
and there are people that come in you know every day to fill out an application (2632A_0047)
and they'll have to bring somebody with them (2632A_0049)
they will show that they completed  four years of high school (2632A_0050)
yeah when it comes to even answering the questions on the simple application they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves (2632A_0051)
it's just incredible (2632A_0055)
really (2632A_0058)
yeah (2632A_0062)
i know (2632A_0064)
they  (2632A_0065)
i forget (2632A_0066)
i think it's  some place in new york because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries (2632A_0067)
i mean they're not getting ready to any of the sports or anything like that (2632A_0070)
they're not cutting in any other corner (2632A_0073)
they're closing the libraries (2632A_0074)
that to me she was a little  switch and priorities (2632A_0075)
you know (2632A_0077)
so do you go to college right now (2632A_0078)
you're so you're a senior now (2632A_0082)
 good for you (2632A_0085)
that's great (2632A_0087)
 is is and see university's at   (2632A_0088)
what'd you say (2632A_0090)
nc state (2632A_0092)
that's a state university (2632A_0093)
i see (2632A_0095)
you're from there also (2632A_0096)
i see (2632A_0102)
well pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one's going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college (2632A_0104)
it's just outrageously expensive (2632A_0106)
 is it (2632A_0108)
we'll still though (2632A_0110)
i mean you know thousands of dollars (2632A_0111)
 well that's good (2632A_0113)
that's good (2632A_0115)
i went to private university (2632A_0116)
and  i don't know (2632A_0117)
i look back now (2632A_0118)
and i i think that i probably would've done it differently if i  you know could do it over again (2632A_0119)
but  i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school some some of them (2632A_0121)
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did (2632A_0122)
i really do (2632A_0124)
that's probably a pretty sad thing to say (2632A_0125)
but  (2632A_0126)
i don't know (2632A_0128)
right (2632A_0129)
what (2632A_0132)
i went to brandeis university (2632A_0134)
to massachusetts (2632A_0136)
and  i really felt like i've been working now for about four years (2632A_0137)
and i i feel like what i've learned working it's a hundred times more valuable than when i learned in school (2632A_0139)
and i know that i'm drawing a lot and when i learned in school you know (2632A_0141)
i probably just subconsciously rely a lot of  (2632A_0142)
but  i don't know (2632A_0143)
my sister is a principal at a school (2632A_0144)
one thing that she's trying to instill in kids  besides just reading  or just some the golden rule (2632A_0145)
she calls them just some basics about  you know you don't take what's not yours (2632A_0147)
and and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission (2632A_0149)
no kidding (2632A_0150)
no pulling hair or anything like that (2632A_0152)
and  the school that she's in as a  it's basically for minorities (2632A_0153)
there's a a large minority population (2632A_0154)
and  she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there (2632A_0155)
i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some (2632A_0156)
yeah (2632A_0162)
it's true (2632A_0163)
and i don't know if it makes them feel better (2632A_0167)
i mean do teachers get (2632A_0168)
 i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasn't a successful (2632A_0169)
and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know (2632A_0171)
that's not much of a challenge (2632A_0173)
but i do you have any idea what you're going to go into when you graduate (2632A_0175)
 yeah (2632A_0177)
do you know where you're going (2632A_0179)
where's that (2632A_0181)
 is that north carolina (2632A_0184)
 okay (2632A_0186)
now (2632A_0188)
don't know that area (2632A_0189)
i don't know it (2632A_0191)
i don't get down there very often (2632A_0193)
 really (2632A_0195)
well the way i picked the final four was  by the the state that had the warmer climate (2632A_0197)
so that's how i chose  (2632A_0199)
so you can tell that i didn't really have that much to do with any of it (2632A_0200)
but (2632A_0202)
so obviously you're into education (2632A_0203)
if you can be going (2632A_0205)
my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now (2632A_0206)
and  (2632A_0208)
i don't know (2632A_0209)
give you a lot of credit (2632A_0210)
i couldn't do it (2632A_0212)
i couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over (2632A_0213)
i know (2632A_0220)
yeah (2632A_0226)

well talking about public education  how did you i'm we're doing a proposal (2632B_0021)
or do at nc state (2632B_0023)
trying to improve that computer science curriculum (2632B_0025)
so that's kind of at a higher level (2632B_0027)
so it's interesting that you chose that topic (2632B_0029)
yeah (2632B_0032)
well i went to private until ninth grade (2632B_0033)
yeah (2632B_0036)
big difference (2632B_0037)
well i'm in  public schools i guess there were there are a lot of you know (2632B_0039)
people can take a lower level courses and get away with learning nothing (2632B_0040)
but  in private school you couldn't do that (2632B_0042)
you know you had to learn (2632B_0044)
bad (2632B_0054)
yeah (2632B_0056)
state just cut a whole bunch of  like i think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget (2632B_0057)
for making all kinds of cuts (2632B_0059)
in college people can not i mean the teachers can't make testing (2632B_0060)
the the libraries cancelling all its subscription (2632B_0061)
it's pretty sorry (2632B_0063)

right (2724A_0041)
yeah (2724A_0046)

 well actually my wife just got me into it (2724A_0055)
and i did  did an internship at the end stoop aerobics research in dallas  cooper clinic (2724A_0056)
and i learned all the health benefits of  you know (2724A_0059)
i was a solid white trainer (2724A_0060)
and all it is weights and anaerobic exercise (2724A_0062)
and then my wife got me into the aerobics i said you really need to do it (2724A_0063)
so once i got into this  internship i learned all the physiological advent advantages to it (2724A_0064)
so i began a program a couple normal probably three or four weeks (2724A_0067)
and i did my first bike rally this saturday (2724A_0068)
did  forty forty miles (2724A_0069)
and  that's the longest i've ever written so far (2724A_0071)
usually you know fifteen or twenty (2724A_0072)
and it was kind of hail (2724A_0074)
it's pretty tough (2724A_0075)
but  i'm looking at  doing a lot more of it 'cause you know my wife is really into it (2724A_0076)
and i i kind of held her back a little bit this weekend (2724A_0078)

my wife would just love that (2724A_0100)
and i may do that sometime (2724A_0102)
i'm just kind of a fledgling into this (2724A_0103)
and it's kinda funny (2724A_0105)
i'd call this number (2724A_0106)
i just read in through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up (2724A_0107)
i mean around texas you you got about five or six (2724A_0110)
if you live around the dallas or you've got five or six every weekend to choose from 'cause there are really into it (2724A_0111)
bicycling is a really big here (2724A_0115)
i didn't know that and you know until i came down here and just kind of caught the fever (2724A_0116)
because i lived in indiana all my life (2724A_0120)
and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something (2724A_0121)
but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here (2724A_0123)
probably (2724A_0128)
yeah (2724A_0130)
yeah (2724A_0132)
there's a lot of bikers around here (2724A_0133)
it's really neat (2724A_0134)
there are a lot a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff (2724A_0136)
 texas bicycle us as in like a newspaper comes out every month (2724A_0137)

have you ever had a  it's kinda slightly off the subject but do you ever had a   blood workout done recently or since you've been biking to see if it (2724A_0155)
cause it really from what i understand really improves your cholesterol (2724A_0160)
and you know it  it kinda knocked down to the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is   low cardiovascular fitness and also  you know the cholesterol (2724A_0162)
it gives you a increased h._d._l. and decreased israel deals (2724A_0164)
yeah (2724A_0166)
so (2724A_0167)
yeah (2724A_0170)
really (2724A_0172)
good (2724A_0174)
you say you're right about a hundred hundred and fifty miles a week (2724A_0176)
yeah (2724A_0178)
that's that's hard core (2724A_0179)
when you get to begin with the winters and all that (2724A_0182)
what time of year to usually embark on your (2724A_0183)
you ride inside if you can't write outside (2724A_0184)
yeah (2724A_0192)
yeah (2724A_0203)
right (2724A_0208)
so are you a change up your routes a lot and people (2724A_0209)
so what school (2724A_0218)
 okay (2724A_0220)
yeah (2724A_0221)
yeah (2724A_0223)
yeah (2724A_0226)
that's true (2724A_0227)
sounds neat (2724A_0228)
it's kind of (2724A_0230)
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never as exercise before and doesn't want to and everything else (2724A_0231)
but you got a guy that writes a hundred and fifty miles a week (2724A_0232)
that's motivating (2724A_0233)
it's a really good (2724A_0235)
well good talking to you (2724A_0236)
keep up the good work (2724A_0239)
alright (2724A_0242)
take care (2724A_0243)
bye (2724A_0245)
so what do you do do you exercise (2724B_0000)
   that's pretty impressive (2724B_0010)
 i guess i bicycle (2724B_0011)
 the amount varies (2724B_0012)
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week (2724B_0013)
 i guess i play softball one night a week (2724B_0015)
and i backpack a lot over the summer (2724B_0016)
yeah (2724B_0018)
so that's about the extent of it (2724B_0019)
i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise (2724B_0020)
but  i guess the bicycling is the one thing all sort of like there if i feel like i need to go exercise (2724B_0021)
 they do it mostly for fun (2724B_0022)
it it it varies (2724B_0025)
 out near my house is pretty hilly (2724B_0026)
 but sometimes i bike to work which is about  fifteen mile trip each way (2724B_0027)
that's mostly flat (2724B_0028)
about forty five fifty minutes (2724B_0030)
yeah (2724B_0032)
it can be a pain (2724B_0033)
 basically  i work on campus (2724B_0034)
so i can see where my bike in my office and walk across the  campus to the  jim use the shower there (2724B_0035)
 but it's it's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year (2724B_0037)
i would commute every day  (2724B_0038)
but it just became such a pain (2724B_0039)
and we were talking you know forty five fifty minutes for biking  and sometimes longer if you had ever swim and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff (2724B_0040)
it was a big hunk hunk of the day (2724B_0043)
 but then of course another hour to get back home (2724B_0044)
 so i've been doing that less and and concentrate more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends (2724B_0045)
not so much (2724B_0048)
 i guess mostly i bike on my own (2724B_0049)
i got a touring bike  i haven't gotten an extended trip (2724B_0050)
how about you (2724B_0053)
what kind of biking (2724B_0054)
 i see (2724B_0077)
it's good to have a partner (2724B_0083)
thinking of doing any like centuries or (2724B_0086)
i just wonder if you're going to do that mostly or more like you know   touring vermont or you know that kind of (2724B_0091)
people seem to get into different aspects (2724B_0094)
is more of a distance (2724B_0095)
and one's more distant (2724B_0096)
want to put some equipment on their bikes and go for a tour (2724B_0097)
  yeah yeah  that's nice (2724B_0117)
yeah (2724B_0119)
yeah (2724B_0124)
i'm not sure why that is (2724B_0125)
generally in the mid west it seems to be lost so much less (2724B_0126)
maybe it's because of the winters  or maybe it just because you know there's there's a lot more flat land you know out in the west (2724B_0127)
that makes biking a better alternative for transportation (2724B_0131)
  that's terrific (2724B_0143)
 i guess as an adult for just about the past three years or so (2724B_0149)
 yeah i guess last time i did it before that was college which is about ten years ago (2724B_0150)
and  (2724B_0152)
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while  until i eat someone discovered all my friends who are basically biking (2724B_0153)
and so i thought i'd try it (2724B_0154)
no (2724B_0156)
i haven't (2724B_0157)
 that's great (2724B_0165)
yeah (2724B_0168)
i've definitely noticed that set a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse (2724B_0169)
you know it gets down to about forty (2724B_0171)
yeah (2724B_0173)
yeah (2724B_0175)
yeah (2724B_0177)
on average (2724B_0180)
yeah (2724B_0181)
nah (2724B_0185)
not that hard core (2724B_0186)
there are some people (2724B_0187)
like there are a lot of people will ride outside in the snow (2724B_0188)
they've got a mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires (2724B_0189)
and i don't do that (2724B_0193)
basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter (2724B_0194)
 i was thinking of getting rollers for the last one or you know 'cause that'll help your balance when your indoor training (2724B_0195)
 but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing  (2724B_0197)
but yeah (2724B_0198)
i mean winters are kind of a problem (2724B_0199)
so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks (2724B_0200)
 but you know up here it's only stopped snowing since then (2724B_0202)
 but yeah (2724B_0204)
it's it's it's pretty good (2724B_0205)
yeah (2724B_0206)
the main the main thing i guess for me it's just to enjoy it because once it starts you mean like you know exercise and a chore lay off of it more (2724B_0207)
 yeah (2724B_0210)
yeah (2724B_0211)
i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week (2724B_0212)
around  about four different routes  from my house (2724B_0213)
sometimes come in school (2724B_0214)
it's nice (2724B_0215)
it's nice writing to school because it's all longer canal path  (2724B_0216)
because it's just it's along the canal up here (2724B_0217)
 university of rochester (2724B_0219)
so it's fairly picture ask (2724B_0222)
and  so it's it's it's a good (2724B_0224)
long as you're not doing it every day it's a good right (2724B_0225)
yeah (2724B_0229)
yeah (2724B_0234)
 good talking to (2724B_0237)
okay (2724B_0240)
but (2724B_0244)
how bad it is (2752A_0004)
do you have smog like they do in california (2752A_0005)
depends on what do you have some sort of temperature and version i tell ya yeah (2752A_0015)
uh-huh (2752A_0022)
what do you think is your primary cause of it (2752A_0023)
you do (2752A_0026)
you really think cars contribute a lot now they've taken land out a game (2752A_0027)
  right (2752A_0039)
i think a lot of it's industrial (2752A_0044)
also think  that  there is a certain amount that comes from all over (2752A_0045)
but it's mostly from older automobiles (2752A_0046)
i don't think in your automobiles or it's polluting  frankly (2752A_0047)
i think that  i think that   (2752A_0049)
if (2752A_0050)
i i've heard a story about (2752A_0051)
something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that had been a matter of fact say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just put getting rid of those cars are still up for money (2752A_0052)
yeah (2752A_0056)
for from cars (2752A_0058)
that is not not totally but just from car (2752A_0059)
okay (2752A_0060)
so that i think would be a tremendous help (2752A_0062)
i happen to drive an old car because it's very economical (2752A_0063)
and it just keeps getting  gives me good service (2752A_0064)
and i don't have in the city to get rid of it i don't think he's really good and that costs me any money (2752A_0065)
and then hand i know it's a much more polluted than any of the (2752A_0067)
but i don't have any incentive to get out of until it dies (2752A_0069)
and that may be (2752A_0071)
 yeah (2752A_0074)
yeah (2752A_0075)
yeah (2752A_0076)
 yeah (2752A_0077)
it's a pretty heavy up here i think (2752A_0078)
but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really believe is the the main problem (2752A_0079)
and and  (2752A_0080)
and   people  i don't think are paying close attention to it in this area is their practice should (2752A_0081)
i i we we seem to have a high a cancer rate up here in maryland (2752A_0082)
yeah (2752A_0084)
and  (2752A_0085)
well  for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rapid (2752A_0088)
and  i think (2752A_0089)
of course prostrate cancer sort of bad for everybody (2752A_0090)
but  this state was like a second (2752A_0091)
why's registered nurse (2752A_0092)
and i think to stay with like second this year from the top in terms of a cancer rate for just all kinds (2752A_0093)
and i can't help but believe that's not part of the calls from pollution (2752A_0094)
i just don't know exactly what it necessarily you know (2752A_0095)
but i just can't believe you know (2752A_0096)
now we have a lot of pollution being caused by clearer for  for which is like free on twelve and three on twenty two (2752A_0098)
free on twenty to an air conditioning systems and houses and all i can heat (2752A_0099)
to use freon twelve and car air conditioners (2752A_0101)
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose their (2752A_0102)
and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere losing soldiers over there they're just not acting as a polluting in our lungs also (2752A_0104)
and having all kinds of affects (2752A_0105)
and (2752A_0106)
well they're working (2752A_0108)
no dupont and down and several other chemical companies are working  to try to come up with a substitute for for (2752A_0109)
and whoever does is going to make a meal (2752A_0111)
because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent and place of than  (2752A_0112)
well they used to be (2752A_0114)
they made him take it out of that (2752A_0115)
right (2752A_0117)
yeah (2752A_0119)
they they they passed a law made him take four cars i've aerosol containers (2752A_0120)
and that was a moving the right direction (2752A_0123)
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem (2752A_0124)
but there are more things we could do (2752A_0125)
and getting rid of old cars i can say is one way to help correct a problem (2752A_0126)
  just trying to i think be careful with the way you have a garbage (2752A_0127)
notice in this day (2752A_0128)
i don't know if you're doing it in texas yeah (2752A_0129)
in this state we have special potatoes and we had to put all arkansan bottles and plastic pieces  you know containers and (2752A_0130)
yeah (2752A_0131)
yeah (2752A_0138)
we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too (2752A_0139)
but they (2752A_0140)
and one of the counties here they're actually doing the trial program i'm having a trash police (2752A_0141)
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid (2752A_0142)
and she spot checks people's trash (2752A_0143)
and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that and you're right they will find you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time (2752A_0147)
yeah (2752A_0152)
she got to get people to say (2752A_0155)
surprisingly enough just handling of trash  can cut pollution  from   from just throwing in a dump or or or or wherever they asked they used to do with it maybe it's to burn it (2752A_0156)
they've stopped that up here too (2752A_0157)
but that that will cut pollution (2752A_0159)
cause you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think the king and and trying to (2752A_0160)
first of cans above and ever go at all (2752A_0161)
well i don't i don't guess they are polluting (2752A_0163)
the plastic containers or like  they may be (2752A_0164)
 i'm not sure that (2752A_0165)
well i think that's very important to do (2752A_0167)
i i really think that  trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing (2752A_0169)
and  that can help to cook i guess (2752A_0171)
i don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants were chemicals out of their hair (2752A_0172)
i would hope that they would help some though (2752A_0173)
that's for sure (2752A_0174)
 good (2752A_0181)
well that  that i think may go on a lot (2752A_0183)
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happen to stay up late night or something (2752A_0184)
i don't think we have a adequate policing  particularly i'm linda (2752A_0185)
 we have good policing at least in this state and and there's several surrounding states in probably in years to accomplish (2752A_0186)
because we have to go down a once a year here in maryland and get our cars exhaust systems check for missions content (2752A_0187)
 no (2752A_0191)
we don't have a state inspection (2752A_0192)
but at the time you sell a car by a car it has to be inspected mistake (2752A_0197)
i don't know (2752A_0200)
 that's something that you'd have to just check with your authority (2752A_0201)
but in this state we have to  pay eight dollars and a half and go to like in the mission station once a year and get every one of our cars check that  had been made starting to nineteen seventy three (2752A_0202)
yeah (2752A_0206)
we don't have inspections like that (2752A_0208)
i'm in maryland (2752A_0209)
virginia they checked that every two years i think (2752A_0210)
and i think that's a good idea too (2752A_0212)
nothing nothing and that sort of has anything to a conclusion that unnecessary (2752A_0213)
but i think it's a good idea (2752A_0214)
the emissions check though is required and marilyn (2752A_0215)
it's also require and virginia  a sister state to do this (2752A_0216)
and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting (2752A_0217)
well if they don't i would imagine in time they get along with  get around too (2752A_0223)
if they don't then that's something i would certainly   suggest you be willing to   before in terms of  (2752A_0224)
yeah (2752A_0226)
yeah (2752A_0227)
 yeah (2752A_0229)
i i agree (2752A_0230)
that's another area we hadn't even discuss (2752A_0231)
that is water pollution and various of the other types of  of  like food pollution (2752A_0232)
you you hardly ever get her into by saying they buy food pollution (2752A_0233)
but i think they're we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country (2752A_0234)
so hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way over pollutants in our food (2752A_0235)
but water pollution (2752A_0236)
i've worried  especially the last few years of i just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking in the like (2752A_0237)
i know a lot more people are going to bottled water (2752A_0239)
yeah (2752A_0243)
pay off (2752A_0244)
yeah (2752A_0245)
yeah (2752A_0259)
i'm absolutely for drinking water out of whales as long as you person course habit (2752A_0260)
it seems (2752A_0261)
and when i was a kid growing up down south  i used to go out of the country where my grandparents (2752A_0262)
and we had (2752A_0263)
one of those drowsy (2752A_0264)
i forget what you call those things (2752A_0265)
and and that was from the best (2752A_0267)
i mean i can still to this day taste that war (2752A_0268)
yeah (2752A_0271)
uh-huh  i bet it was (2752A_0277)
yeah (2752A_0279)
yeah (2752A_0280)
once you spend two drapes a deep enough we all filter through all the earth or anything i think that  (2752A_0281)
it depends a course where you are (2752A_0282)
good well though i think is very healthy (2752A_0283)
okay (2752B_0000)
yeah (2752B_0001)
we do have pollution in houston (2752B_0002)
well it it (2752B_0006)
uh-huh (2752B_0007)
think it depends on  you know what the the cloud cover (2752B_0008)
like right now it's  it's kind of overcast (2752B_0009)
it's hot (2752B_0010)
to try and tries to sun (2752B_0012)
it's a it's holding in this this pollution (2752B_0013)
uh-huh (2752B_0014)
i think so (2752B_0016)
and  (2752B_0017)
we have  pasadena taxes which is sort of between here you know heading toward galveston (2752B_0019)
and it's still part is part of the day he is (2752B_0020)
well i think it's industry (2752B_0024)
and i think it's cars (2752B_0025)
uh-huh (2752B_0028)
well maybe not (2752B_0029)
but it it sure sure (2752B_0030)
you know (2752B_0031)
i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car (2752B_0032)
and  sometimes  i can really smell especially diesel and things like that (2752B_0033)
you know comes right in to my air conditioner (2752B_0035)
and you know my head must (2752B_0036)
i'm so stop that right now (2752B_0037)
don't know if it's  it's it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that (2752B_0040)
part of it (2752B_0041)
you mean a fifty percent pollution title from that comes from (2752B_0055)
right (2752B_0070)
yeah i'll have delusion in your part of the country  probably in history (2752B_0073)
really (2752B_0083)
what (2752B_0086)
any particular con artist all costs (2752B_0087)
well what can we do about the the air conditioning problem (2752B_0107)
yeah (2752B_0110)
is that also what's in  (2752B_0113)
so so the air song is still arizona (2752B_0116)
but it doesn't have anything that stand (2752B_0118)
uh-huh (2752B_0122)
they just started started doing that (2752B_0132)
it's (2752B_0133)
you're not you don't have to (2752B_0134)
that you know (2752B_0135)
i know i am (2752B_0136)
no kidding (2752B_0144)
really (2752B_0145)
is that right (2752B_0148)
well we need to do something (2752B_0150)
we need to get serious about it (2752B_0151)
how much does  planning more trees and things like that hill (2752B_0166)
okay (2752B_0168)
 i hope that's for sure (2752B_0170)
 it seems like there was something going on around here that (2752B_0175)
longest chemical plants and all refineries and those kinds of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff (2752B_0177)
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway (2752B_0179)
i think they got caught (2752B_0180)
but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on (2752B_0182)
we have to  we had to have a state inspection every year (2752B_0188)
you don't have that (2752B_0190)
yeah (2752B_0194)
so i'm i'm assuming that you know they they check everything first date (2752B_0198)
yeah (2752B_0199)
but that's all they checked for (2752B_0203)
they don't (2752B_0204)
if you're tired they're good enough or your brakes are good enough (2752B_0205)
virginia we do that and (2752B_0211)
 i have to check (2752B_0218)
i'm not sure if if our state inspection (2752B_0219)
once a year has to do (2752B_0220)
they check the  (2752B_0221)
certainly suggest you  i would (2752B_0225)
or anything that claim that the air the water or or or anything (2752B_0228)
now that's another area we didn't even discuss pollution and the other types of foods solution pollution but i think they're we have a pretty good handle on inspection of food to this country so hopefully we're not ingesting too much food a lot of pollution worried especially for years about the water supply we have in this country is  (2752B_0238)
well (2752B_0240)
and that's not necessarily the answer either (2752B_0241)
because they found out that that's just comes out of somebody's pass (2752B_0242)
so (2752B_0246)
a lot of these (2752B_0247)
well you know a lotta people have (2752B_0249)
in fact in this area too (2752B_0250)
you know (2752B_0251)
yeah (2752B_0252)
you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're what you're drinking (2752B_0254)
i know a lot of people you know have that (2752B_0255)
you know you have to wonder that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they don't i don't get a check (2752B_0256)
when we were (2752B_0269)
when i was growing up i lived in huntsville alabama (2752B_0270)
and their water supply i came from  spring (2752B_0272)
and it was like ice cold spring water (2752B_0274)
and i guess parts of the city still you know get that (2752B_0275)
but  that was that was really wonderful (2752B_0276)
really really good (2752B_0278)
the latin american situation (2753A_0000)
the last development died no  whereas the military in financial assistance columbia for the for the drug  control (2753A_0001)
and i support that fully (2753A_0004)
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it (2753A_0005)
but at least where we're going to the source of the problem (2753A_0006)
and other sources supply (2753A_0007)
the problem is (2753A_0010)
but the source of supplies there (2753A_0011)
in fact i think a lot of (2753A_0014)
i've been to  peru several times (2753A_0015)
i've never made it to other parts of south america (2753A_0017)
 i haven't been to (2753A_0018)
and they need some assistance down there (2753A_0019)
and i'm sure that  as an undeveloped country they look look for it (2753A_0020)
but there is not exactly a lot of  fiscal responsibility there (2753A_0021)
yes (2753A_0024)
right (2753A_0025)
and i i think that  they need guidance and assistance (2753A_0027)
but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also (2753A_0028)
no no they and the poor are extremely poor (2753A_0033)
i know (2753A_0034)
  some of the areas and in texas seem poor (2753A_0037)
but until you've seen some of those  native latin americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is (2753A_0038)
and  the worst thing i've ever had i think was someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets and lima (2753A_0041)
 yes (2753A_0043)
yes (2753A_0044)
 that that's a joke (2753A_0048)
the the graft and they  payoffs down there aren't accepted way (2753A_0049)
in a way (2753A_0050)
and there's there's a sad joke (2753A_0053)
i guess all jokes are really sad (2753A_0054)
but there's a joke about the ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator and the us and was taken to his home for dinner (2753A_0055)
and the homeless (2753A_0056)
they had to five or six servings you know and and a lot of expensive  holdings and all that (2753A_0057)
and the ambassador as that goes i know what you may cause the us (2753A_0058)
how can you afford all of this (2753A_0059)
and he said come on (2753A_0060)
walked out in the back yard (2753A_0061)
and they  centered said you see that hospital over there (2753A_0062)
and the best but i said yes (2753A_0063)
any petted his pocket (2753A_0064)
he said fifteen percent (2753A_0065)
you said you see that school over there (2753A_0066)
and they said yes (2753A_0067)
and he pot petted his pocket me fifteen percent (2753A_0068)
so (2753A_0069)
so the next year the senator went to latin america to visit the ambassador and was treated the dinner and his home (2753A_0071)
it was twice as large and four times as many servants (2753A_0072)
well i know how poor your country is (2753A_0073)
how can you afford this  in such a poor country (2753A_0074)
you should come out (2753A_0075)
walked on the back yard (2753A_0076)
you said you see that hospital over there (2753A_0077)
senator look (2753A_0078)
you couldn't see anything (2753A_0079)
said no (2753A_0080)
and then bastard positive petted his pocket said one hundred percent (2753A_0081)
so (2753A_0082)
yeah (2753A_0084)
it's a sad story (2753A_0086)
yes (2753A_0089)
yes (2753A_0090)
but it  it is a problem (2753A_0091)
yeah (2753A_0102)
yeah the other instances i think go there inability to to handle things and to colorado and hepatitis epidemics now in in latin america (2753A_0107)
and it shows the the on preparedness for such such a problem (2753A_0110)
and yet there's some (2753A_0112)
yeah (2753A_0114)
and there there are so rich and resources there (2753A_0116)
they're very rich and oil and and gas (2753A_0117)
and they're very rich and gold and silver and very rich and and  natural resources such as the fish and temper and and copper and all types of  resources (2753A_0118)
but they (2753A_0122)
yes (2753A_0124)
but they don't have (2753A_0126)
it's sort of like russia (2753A_0127)
they don't have the ability to develop it (2753A_0128)
right (2753A_0130)
and they they're very what (2753A_0131)
you're you're exactly right (2753A_0137)
yeah (2753A_0141)
it's sort of illustrated by the world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business (2753A_0142)
because they offer assistance than don't get rebates (2753A_0143)
so it's sort of a bombing of the nose  approach (2753A_0146)
they need it (2753A_0147)
and they need to live up to a certain regulations and and expectations (2753A_0148)
but  then don't (2753A_0149)
and of course it's a very volatile government  situation too (2753A_0150)
you know (2753A_0158)
disillusioned discussed at one time and i think that's real merit on the drug situation is that the the us government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are and trying to to beef up the military and to do all of a thing (2753A_0166)
so i think it'd be cheaper to buy it and destroy it (2753A_0167)
which would still give the  the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the  the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for them (2753A_0168)
and it was saved the u s money in in the long run how much they're trying to (2753A_0169)
true (2753A_0173)
no (2753A_0175)
yeah (2753A_0176)
and i i think finding an alternate too that would be good (2753A_0178)
right (2753A_0180)
teen beef (2753A_0184)
yeah (2753A_0185)
yeah (2753A_0186)
i would come up with a solution yet so (2753A_0189)
yeah (2753A_0196)
yes (2753A_0197)
well one of these days i hope we'll find some some way to substitute  good prompt for illegal ones (2753A_0198)
i agree (2753A_0201)
yeah (2753A_0203)
it has (2753A_0204)
very good (2753A_0208)
right (2753A_0210)
thank you (2753A_0211)
bye (2753A_0213)
that's true (2753B_0012)
very definitely so (2753B_0013)
no (2753B_0022)
very immature and respect (2753B_0023)
i agree (2753B_0029)
i think that for so long power financially  governmentally every which way was in the hands of such a few that there's not to middle class that we we perceive (2753B_0030)
are extremely poor (2753B_0035)
that's great (2753B_0036)
no i'm just very happy to get that (2753B_0042)
i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia (2753B_0045)
and this is very much his reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor (2753B_0047)
yup (2753B_0083)
intentions and tend to (2753B_0088)
i know (2753B_0092)
i have a sister in law who is from nicaragua (2753B_0093)
and her family (2753B_0094)
her father was a fairly  high ranking official under some most  (2753B_0095)
and when that one down the tubes they had to get out (2753B_0096)
and seventeen children filtered through into into america through guatemala through mexico who honduras (2753B_0098)
you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until (2753B_0101)
and now  couple of the older ones stayed or went back (2753B_0103)
but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and our our leading productive lives (2753B_0104)
but you know (2753B_0106)
yes (2753B_0108)
yes (2753B_0111)
 the story she tells you know are just unnerving justin (2753B_0113)
well near rainy him (2753B_0123)
technology (2753B_0129)
wow (2753B_0132)
you know they're very willing to be taught in many cases now too (2753B_0133)
but you know there's just always just kind of resentment underlying (2753B_0134)
i think that when they receive help from us they want it (2753B_0135)
but they don't want it (2753B_0136)
that's kind of a catch twenty two (2753B_0138)
yeah (2753B_0144)
yeah (2753B_0145)
right (2753B_0151)
i think that you know (2753B_0152)
somewhat of sarcastic view (2753B_0153)
but i'm sure that some of those drugs ours (2753B_0154)
they they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that's the way to bring us to our knees more on their level (2753B_0155)
you know that's really a kind of a far fetched i (2753B_0159)
i know (2753B_0160)
i don't think people probably say or think those things consciously (2753B_0161)
but it's like in any sibling rivalry (2753B_0163)
we're here in the same (2753B_0165)
in the long run (2753B_0170)
and then the short run probably (2753B_0172)
of course then 'cause you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and gross something that was productive for human kind (2753B_0174)
yeah (2753B_0177)
i mean even there even they're legal crops or things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical stand point of view coffee tobacco you know (2753B_0179)
there certainly legal (2753B_0187)
but they're certainly not healthy (2753B_0188)
you know (2753B_0190)
not that i know (2753B_0191)
hi sharing about it i suppose (2753B_0193)
right (2753B_0194)
yeah (2753B_0195)
well let's just hope that the powers that be  have time to a little bit once in a while to to think in some farther reaching avenues and you and i do here tonight (2753B_0199)
uh-huh (2753B_0200)
well it's been nice chatting with you (2753B_0202)
i appreciate it (2753B_0205)
and tell your wife or hopefully i get her again sometime (2753B_0206)
it's kinda nice to to see all friends now you say (2753B_0209)
right (2753B_0212)
okay (2836A_0000)
 as far as you know crime and the cities i'm sure like in years it's pretty pretty bad (2836A_0001)
 probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies (2836A_0002)
they asked him probably murder or the two top ones that we have (2836A_0003)
how 'bout you (2836A_0006)
problem probably right if you look at it from that standpoint (2836A_0012)
what (2836A_0014)
is there anything that  that you particularly concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing (2836A_0015)
do you live in a real small town or or out in the country (2836A_0021)
how far out from the city i mean (2836A_0024)
about fifteen miles (2836A_0026)
i live in a little suburb  which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so (2836A_0027)
but it's pretty congested (2836A_0029)
we are considered in the country (2836A_0030)
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country (2836A_0032)
our major crimes in our immediate town  is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs  report it (2836A_0034)
however i'm sure they're there (2836A_0037)
but  right now our neighborhood is running about  eighty percent of the homeowners had been robbed sometime during their their  existence in that neighborhood (2836A_0039)
and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar assist or you know  burger alarms  and including me out to the outer perimeter type  devices sensors and things like that (2836A_0043)
cut back you know considerably (2836A_0048)
it it just shifted from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood (2836A_0049)
so it's still  remains city wide pretty high (2836A_0050)
 i would say the majority of it happening during the day  between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon (2836A_0052)
most (2836A_0054)
well most families most families they're young (2836A_0057)
both people are working (2836A_0058)
so they're happening during the hours are gone from work (2836A_0060)
 so  i would say that's probably their prime motivation (2836A_0062)
they'll they'll stock your house and  look at your pattern and then go from there (2836A_0063)
 they classify most professionals (2836A_0065)
 you get a few of 'em that are a little bit sloppy or  just taking  you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick (2836A_0067)
probably the biggest items that  that you get in our neighborhood or it would be the high class to automobiles (2836A_0069)
say these volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for a jury or the major target (2836A_0070)
and that sort of stuff (2836A_0073)
very few you know penny penny any stuff (2836A_0075)
well  the police force for one (2836A_0077)
i think they could  definitely add to the police force and the type of equipment that they use (2836A_0078)
 it's (2836A_0079)
 the right now i think  we're about thirty thousand people (2836A_0080)
and there's only eight officers to control there for that amount of people which is not very many (2836A_0081)
and (2836A_0087)
well the (2836A_0092)
course in our particular state  we have the prison overcrowding whatever (2836A_0093)
so they're getting the early release  (2836A_0094)
yeah (2836A_0097)
and it's (2836A_0098)
i think what they need to do it stopped building more jails and start giving us different sentences  (2836A_0099)
but (2836A_0100)
that would be certainly be a deterrent (2836A_0102)
and  not necessarily you know  give into their  human rights and desires (2836A_0104)
you know if they're overcrowded just suffocate  (2836A_0105)
i think they'd have to go the extra measures to make sure a person is guilty you know in a lot of cases (2836A_0107)
of course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof (2836A_0108)
i'd rather see a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence to convict somebody (2836A_0112)
and those convict especially of you know murder and and  you know major crimes  to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow through with that (2836A_0115)
 especially in the case of murder (2836A_0119)
 i know in my case i have my wife and daughter were kidnapped during house robbery back in eighty five (2836A_0121)
and we caught the individual got caught (2836A_0125)
we  we went through the court system and all that sort of thing (2836A_0126)
and  you know to cancer kidnapping  you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the main language the whole nine yards  you know the guy i only got five years (2836A_0129)
and he was out within two months because of the pearl system (2836A_0135)
so what (2836A_0136)
do what now (2836A_0138)
 no (2836A_0140)
i'm not real familiar with that (2836A_0141)
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after (2836A_0146)
and they said well you know he he has no job (2836A_0147)
nothing (2836A_0148)
there's nothing that he has it that you could go after (2836A_0149)
yeah (2836A_0152)
 you're very seldom (2836A_0153)
yeah (2836A_0155)
they don't do that (2836A_0156)
of course they pay them (2836A_0157)
but they don't you don't (2836A_0158)
you are the insurance companies never see that many (2836A_0159)
and  you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders (2836A_0162)
they  they've been in jail before (2836A_0163)
they've been released several times which is another  deal i hate to see (2836A_0166)
but  you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and  in car theft on top of it destroys my car (2836A_0170)
we're out you know  you know fifteen thousand dollars (2836A_0177)
and you know the guy gets out and two months (2836A_0178)
and he goes out and commit to that again (2836A_0181)
in fact he's back in jail now (2836A_0182)
so what what  (2836A_0183)
yeah (2836A_0185)
what what deterrent does he really have (2836A_0186)
yeah (2836A_0188)
i think in our in our neighborhood vigil any is  is becoming a real real possibility (2836A_0189)
 we've had a couple and says we're break ins where the the people have actually you know shot the people (2836A_0191)
and  return offenders have (2836A_0193)
they've actually waited form where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood (2836A_0194)
rob one house (2836A_0195)
and other people were white up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands (2836A_0196)
of course it doesn't always work out in their favor (2836A_0198)
but  nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of this (2836A_0200)
you can you can get some of them (2836A_0203)
you can't get all of us (2836A_0206)
 and we're beginning to see more and more that (2836A_0208)
yeah (2836A_0210)
yeah (2836A_0213)
that's i mean that certainly you know possibility and (2836A_0214)
we have had a few cases where the guys broke it in you know during the middle of night and got himself shot to death (2836A_0215)
and  it helps for a while (2836A_0217)
but then just nothing different set of people come in (2836A_0219)
most of the people are trained in from out outside of the state (2836A_0220)
 i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught there from places like up in oklahoma in louisiana arkansas you know across the border (2836A_0222)
so you know people who don't really read the newspapers in our town or whatever (2836A_0224)
it's not many from the local communities (2836A_0226)
but  it's a problem (2836A_0228)
and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in different their penalties (2836A_0229)
would be a definite deterrent (2836A_0231)
and and giving the  police  agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people (2836A_0232)
right (2836A_0238)
i don't like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal (2836A_0245)
they they went to all (2836A_0248)
 well i don't actually live in the city (2836B_0007)
but  i'd probably say that's roughly right (2836B_0008)
i mean crimes against property seemed to out number crimes against for life (2836B_0009)
but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one prime crimes are probably solicitations prostitution  and sales drug (2836B_0010)
 where i live now it's it's not so bad (2836B_0016)
i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it (2836B_0017)
 but i do have friends who live in the city (2836B_0018)
and i think that they get a lot of fall out from this war on drug thing  just because there are like crack houses you know on down the street and stuff like that (2836B_0019)
i live out in the country (2836B_0022)
yeah (2836B_0023)
i'm about fifteen miles out (2836B_0025)
wow (2836B_0040)
huge (2836B_0042)
are they are there any theories on why this was happening (2836B_0051)
why (2836B_0055)
why (2836B_0056)
so they're professionals (2836B_0064)
  well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime (2836B_0076)
but i mean that's going to tend to (2836B_0088)
and it seems to me that's sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly (2836B_0089)
increase the probability of somebody's being caught a little bit (2836B_0090)
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes and the first place (2836B_0091)
they're doing that in our state (2836B_0096)
so you think that would be a deterrent (2836B_0101)
well what about an innocent person who happens to him and found guilty (2836B_0106)
so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody (2836B_0111)
right (2836B_0120)
 wow (2836B_0122)
 my goodness (2836B_0124)
right (2836B_0132)
wow (2836B_0134)
did you see them out of the civil system (2836B_0137)
did you sue him under the civil (2836B_0139)
but you'd probably see them for mental english or something right and try to get money from (2836B_0142)
yeah (2836B_0150)
makes you wish they had  still hadn't ventured servitude for this sort of thing (2836B_0151)
but the give the guy a job in prison and they can pay as damn debt (2836B_0154)
and (2836B_0160)
that's too bad (2836B_0161)
yeah (2836B_0171)
i think that's (2836B_0172)
yeah (2836B_0174)
gives you a sympathy for the vigilantes (2836B_0184)
yeah (2836B_0187)
 my god (2836B_0192)
right (2836B_0199)
that's a deterrent to everything pretty homeowner might be armed right in a way (2836B_0209)
there you break (2836B_0211)
and you're going to get shot (2836B_0212)
wow (2836B_0223)
yeah (2836B_0230)
yeah (2836B_0233)
i mean i i tend to agree with you (2836B_0236)
i think  what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crime so  there's no reason to enforce us and spend time and money doing it and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt (2836B_0237)
and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrent is  if someone is found guilty of a a felony level offense they lose their citizenship (2836B_0240)
and they lose their constitutional rights you know (2836B_0241)
and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them (2836B_0244)
i know (2836B_0246)
i think i think that's ridiculous (2836B_0247)
yeah (2838A_0001)
right (2838A_0013)
yeah (2838A_0024)
right (2838A_0026)
yeah (2838A_0032)
right (2838A_0034)
they do (2838A_0039)
you boy you can get them on either side (2838A_0040)
and just like you say (2838A_0041)
 well i think i i guess i'd have to place myself  probably seven or eight (2838A_0042)
because (2838A_0043)
yeah (2838A_0044)
i'm sorry excuse me (2838A_0046)
two or three (2838A_0047)
uh-huh going the wrong direction (2838A_0049)
 because  we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house (2838A_0050)
and a father kept the bullets in a separate place (2838A_0053)
the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to (2838A_0054)
 he knew most places were loaded the gun (2838A_0055)
and they were playing cowboys indians (2838A_0056)
they shut down the little boy right between the eyes (2838A_0057)
so  (2838A_0059)
i mean it's (2838A_0060)
it destroyed two families  in just that instance (2838A_0061)
and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection  (2838A_0064)
having worked at one time in baltimore (2838A_0065)
i don't know if you're in a big city (2838A_0067)
are you (2838A_0069)
alice (2838A_0070)
that's a big city (2838A_0072)
 then you know that   (2838A_0074)
if you live anywhere real close to that (2838A_0075)
the safety is (2838A_0076)
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and (2838A_0077)
but   we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up (2838A_0078)
 i  (2838A_0079)
once   knew a fellow that had had been a policeman (2838A_0080)
and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he's going to assume that you know how to use it (2838A_0081)
he's going to you know try to shoot first (2838A_0082)
 so you know if you've got one (2838A_0084)
 and if not (2838A_0085)
 and then usually they (2838A_0086)
he's got a knife or whatever they could throw in it (2838A_0087)
i mean you know they (2838A_0088)
he said that it it it's better not to have (2838A_0091)
especially myself now i'm a widow (2838A_0092)
and  (2838A_0093)
i so i'm i'm on my handicapped son is is not at home i'm by myself (2838A_0094)
but  there's (2838A_0095)
i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really  playing russian roulette if you do (2838A_0096)
that's right (2838A_0101)
right (2838A_0103)
right (2838A_0106)
that's right (2838A_0108)
right (2838A_0114)
that's right (2838A_0119)
i know (2838A_0121)
no (2838A_0123)
yeah (2838A_0125)
true (2838A_0126)
that's that's that's true (2838A_0127)
right (2838A_0134)
well they (2838A_0137)
that's how i feel too (2838A_0138)
well (2838A_0139)
even here where i work  we have a gun club (2838A_0140)
and of course those people are very avid (2838A_0141)
they you know they say there should be no ban (2838A_0142)
it's not (2838A_0145)
but i can't see why any   on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun (2838A_0146)
 you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide (2838A_0148)
but there are a few guns that  just are not a sport (2838A_0149)
or i mean (2838A_0150)
i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport county neither (2838A_0151)
so  i i think they should have at least some control over of those things (2838A_0153)
 and when you were speaking about they can check up you know credit cards (2838A_0154)
well i i understand about the privacy act and everything (2838A_0155)
why can't they check to see if the person who was applying for this gun has had a record (2838A_0156)
that to me would not be an unreasonable thing (2838A_0157)
and if they do (2838A_0159)
of course the argument with the people in the gun club  is that  well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal 'em anyway (2838A_0160)
and so it's not going to be that they're buying them (2838A_0162)
'course mom do (2838A_0163)
so it it is a hard question (2838A_0165)
right (2838A_0168)
yeah (2838A_0169)
that's right (2838A_0172)
okay (2838A_0177)
thanks for talking (2838A_0178)
controls seems to be i'd rather  timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise (2838B_0000)
and  the the interesting scale that they assigned at  the one being abandon ten being no regulations are totally free (2838B_0002)
i'd had to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess (2838B_0003)
i i don't mind regulating all of the the guns (2838B_0004)
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types (2838B_0005)
now that the wisdom as to which types that's going to be a debate forever i would assume (2838B_0006)
 the method of of controlling it well that's all into how much money you want to put into the controls (2838B_0007)
 one point that was made in the house hearings (2838B_0008)
the representative stood up and said that  you know we can check i guys credit card instantly (2838B_0010)
but  we don't want to check your background (2838B_0011)
course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes (2838B_0012)
but they're still the technology exist to to check it if they want (2838B_0015)
so it's kind of  (2838B_0016)
 i guess you can put a dollar figure on and if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that (2838B_0017)
and then you've got a group of people that decide that there's there's no particular reason to have them at all (2838B_0018)
and you gotta balance so it was against the ones that say there is some sport to it (2838B_0019)
and i guess i would fall more in the realm that i liked the sport issue of it (2838B_0020)
i i could give it up without too much trouble (2838B_0021)
not the world's most pleasurable thing (2838B_0022)
and it cost a bit to do it  finding ranges and things like that (2838B_0023)
 i have shot variety of guns for a number of years (2838B_0027)
but it's just it's not like golf or whatever (2838B_0028)
there are other things that you could go do (2838B_0029)
so  i i don't see the the joy of shooting is it that much of a driving factor (2838B_0030)
i think  society could easily swing the scale the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids tend to get hurt (2838B_0031)
i don't even keep the gun in our house (2838B_0033)
so we don't have that problem (2838B_0035)
but  (2838B_0036)
it's a hard hard topic i guess (2838B_0037)
a lot of people have a lot of heart issue a lot of hard feelings about it (2838B_0038)
right (2838B_0062)
dallas (2838B_0068)
yeah (2838B_0073)
right (2838B_0083)
right (2838B_0089)
yeah (2838B_0098)
about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the person was coming your way (2838B_0099)
once you're surprised it's too late (2838B_0100)
and and the rare (2838B_0102)
you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming (2838B_0105)
had time to do anything about it (2838B_0107)
and i don't have that problem (2838B_0109)
i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one (2838B_0110)
and the  in r._a.s  cleaned that the  the constitutional right to bear arms and that whole statement  (2838B_0111)
it's hard to know the original intent (2838B_0112)
but i i don't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that  yeah it's the right to to arm  militia in as opposed to just the general public (2838B_0113)
and you have a you have a ernie rights (2838B_0115)
not just a privilege as it were if you are going to serve and the militia (2838B_0116)
and you have a right to have that arm (2838B_0117)
but  (2838B_0118)
you know there's all sorts arguments (2838B_0120)
i don't even worry about what the original intent (2838B_0122)
they didn't have this problem back then (2838B_0124)
we change our rights with our social status (2838B_0128)
man given rights (2838B_0131)
and they can be taken away by a man (2838B_0132)
so (2838B_0133)
 the people that hide behind that i don't worry about (2838B_0135)
to live in another country they want (2838B_0136)
right (2838B_0147)
right (2838B_0152)
right (2838B_0158)
right (2838B_0161)
yeah (2838B_0164)
just tends to strap only the legitimate people (2838B_0166)
most regulation does (2838B_0167)
most (2838B_0170)
very difficult to  legislate  crooks or whatever you want to hire you on word it (2838B_0171)
so it's (2838B_0173)
well this may be a never ending topic (2838B_0174)
i got a couple of calls waiting on me (2838B_0175)
so i'd better let you go (2838B_0176)
okay (2838B_0179)
nah (3528A_0000)
i understand we're supposed to talk about spice (3528A_0003)
flat yeah hope you know very bad it than i do (3528A_0005)
 is that right (3528A_0007)
i haven't read these books (3528A_0009)
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books (3528A_0010)
well (3528A_0012)
i don't think he was truthful in light of what he did in texas (3528A_0013)
so i wasn't sure how credible avon (3528A_0014)
but anyway what do you think we've gained from the space fights (3528A_0016)
ego trip (3528A_0020)
 is that right (3528A_0027)
where do you live (3528A_0035)
you live in (3528A_0037)
am i talking to utah right now (3528A_0038)
 great (3528A_0040)
cause i'm in dallas (3528A_0042)
uh-huh (3528A_0049)
i see (3528A_0051)
carolyn ranch (3528A_0053)
is her name rash carolyn range (3528A_0055)
i see (3528A_0057)
i see (3528A_0059)
well you probably know a lot of bad (3528A_0061)
i wasn't sure that they were blaming that split spice disaster all one cat (3528A_0062)
i hadn't heard that (3528A_0064)
 yeah (3528A_0077)
 yeah (3528A_0082)
i would think so too (3528A_0083)
you never think about that (3528A_0086)
i think it'd be harder to get up and eat it would be (3528A_0088)
right (3528A_0095)
well i saw a lot of some of those early space skipped two old (3528A_0097)
and i'm sure you've seen more of them then i have (3528A_0098)
but you could see this cartoon (3528A_0101)
they had them in the house (3528A_0104)
that you could see where they would come off in them how hot it got because it was still the join them which was quite interesting (3528A_0106)
well (3528A_0109)
excuse me go ahead (3528A_0110)
more of a motors uh-huh uh-huh so (3528A_0114)
well these were the ones that john glen went up in you know the old old one (3528A_0116)
the very first one (3528A_0120)
the little things (3528A_0121)
yeah (3528A_0123)
they really were (3528A_0124)
and  (3528A_0125)
 yeah (3528A_0129)
and  the whole thing of small (3528A_0130)
yeah you i mean you actually put it out yeah (3528A_0131)
you put it around you pretty much (3528A_0133)
so small (3528A_0134)
well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from us by (3528A_0136)
did he go into that in the book (3528A_0137)
i guess that's just to sell us  (3528A_0139)
 yeah (3528A_0144)
well that's true (3528A_0149)
that's right (3528A_0152)
what do you think we should continue to support it at the lab (3528A_0153)
i thought probably one of the things that where we do and that they didn't tell us what spot (3528A_0154)
because i think those satellites you know not satellites but the spice could really spy (3528A_0155)
and with the with the russia's the minds i didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level (3528A_0158)
yeah (3528A_0162)
yeah (3528A_0169)
uh-huh (3528A_0170)
i don't either (3528A_0171)
yeah (3528A_0175)
yeah (3528B_0001)
thank you (3528B_0002)
yes (3528B_0004)
wow i just got through any reading  space by james missionary (3528B_0006)
it's all of that helped out a little bit i think (3528B_0008)
well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes (3528B_0011)
is that right (3528B_0015)
well  i'm not sure to be honest with you (3528B_0017)
 there's going to the moon seem to be  exciting adventure (3528B_0018)
and  it wasn't yeah (3528B_0019)
with nice to go there (3528B_0022)
but i don't know that they're really benefited mankind that much (3528B_0023)
i happen to live not too far away from (3528B_0025)
well i've actually worked for the company that  has been blame for the challenger disaster  (3528B_0026)
and  you know that's been kind of a real negative feeling here (3528B_0030)
it's (3528B_0031)
sure it was  you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there (3528B_0033)
and it's (3528B_0034)
well we live in utah (3528B_0036)
yeah (3528B_0041)
i have a sister lives in dallas (3528B_0047)
that's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for pennies there (3528B_0048)
so (3528B_0052)
pardon me (3528B_0054)
no her name was my last name is get more (3528B_0056)
and her her husband's name is his last name was weight (3528B_0058)
yeah (3528B_0060)
well they were (3528B_0065)
there was  (3528B_0066)
apparently the specifications for the joints  (3528B_0067)
they were not to perform in  cold weather (3528B_0068)
and  apparently there was definitely  i joined that did not seal (3528B_0069)
and if you've ever seen the size of those  motors that put it in the face (3528B_0070)
i mean they're as long as the football field practically and about twelve foot diameter (3528B_0073)
and there's a lot of pressure a lot of threats to get that much weight off in the air (3528B_0076)
so it's this book was interesting (3528B_0078)
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome too (3528B_0080)
it's a very complex  situation to go into space (3528B_0081)
they were (3528B_0084)
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem is to re enter the earth atmosphere (3528B_0085)
yeah (3528B_0087)
yeah (3528B_0089)
but they have to come in there just to ride angle (3528B_0091)
come into the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back in the space (3528B_0092)
and if they come into it at a different angle there's so much friction that it burns a month (3528B_0094)
so (3528B_0096)
yeah (3528B_0105)
yeah (3528B_0107)
i've never i've never seen the actual capsule (3528B_0108)
seem more more of the motors for that that they produced out there (3528B_0113)
yeah (3528B_0119)
people have commented how  they were surprised at how small they were (3528B_0122)
look pretty confining (3528B_0126)
right (3528B_0132)
 really (3528B_0138)
one thing (3528B_0140)
i know one thing they they mentioned that i didn't get from the book by the way (3528B_0141)
they've talked about (3528B_0142)
they're able to manufacture god different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in his ear all gravity state but they turned out to being almost  nearly perfect as far as the ball bearing (3528B_0143)
perfectly round (3528B_0146)
but i'm not sure you have to go to have space to achieve that zero gravity (3528B_0148)
yeah (3528B_0151)
uh-huh (3528B_0156)
yes (3528B_0159)
 i think they have cut it back to be honest with ya from from the glory days when they did the apollo shots in the moon (3528B_0161)
 i appreciate having the satellites (3528B_0165)
you know that certainly made it nice for other purpose (3528B_0166)
i don't know if you have a satellite dish or not (3528B_0167)
we don't (3528B_0168)
but i i know that certainly helps a lot in that regard  (3528B_0172)
okay (3756A_0000)
have you painted something lightly (3756A_0001)
yeah (3756A_0005)
 yeah (3756A_0007)
other bedroom (3756A_0008)
yeah (3756A_0012)
yeah (3756A_0013)
yeah (3756A_0014)
 yeah (3756A_0017)
 heavens (3756A_0020)
i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom (3756A_0021)
i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know they  but it it blows the blow ceiling you know where you get around the edge (3756A_0024)
how do you get the edge though (3756A_0033)
this (3756A_0035)
 i see (3756A_0037)
 well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too (3756A_0043)
 really (3756A_0046)
 nice (3756A_0050)
yeah (3756A_0053)
that'd be nice (3756A_0059)
to tone or to town you know (3756A_0063)
right (3756A_0069)
but i have a problem (3756A_0071)
i can't get up high (3756A_0072)
and we can't paint the chimney (3756A_0073)
we have one of those letters (3756A_0075)
we're just not willing to get up that high (3756A_0076)
 we did too (3756A_0083)
did it in the fall (3756A_0084)
and it's just it's too hot (3756A_0085)
it's really scary (3756A_0086)
and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that (3756A_0087)
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional (3756A_0091)
yeah (3756A_0094)
the blowers (3756A_0102)
    i know what you're talking about  (3756A_0105)
scaffold (3756A_0108)
yeah (3756A_0109)
yeah (3756A_0116)
 my (3756A_0120)
so that was worth it get in a professional for that (3756A_0121)
 i think that's what we might have to deal with it to him (3756A_0125)
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourselves and talking it and everything ourselves (3756A_0126)
it wasn't too bad (3756A_0128)
and you say (3756A_0129)
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty (3756A_0131)
you know since it's a one story (3756A_0133)
but we did  like too heavy coats over it (3756A_0134)
and then that way you know your assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it (3756A_0135)
my word (3756A_0144)
 my horror (3756A_0150)
 my word (3756A_0159)
so that was really worth it paint in his own house (3756A_0161)
uh-huh (3756A_0164)
 my word (3756A_0166)
well they really say isn't that way (3756A_0167)
yeah (3756A_0169)
i think we're going to do another bathroom (3756A_0170)
i think i'll probably just do it no roller (3756A_0171)
want to do about the same color and just be a little (3756A_0172)
 i know (3756A_0175)
but it's that it's the textured whoa you can still (3756A_0176)
yeah (3756B_0002)
that room i showed you (3756B_0004)
and then since then we've painted the bedroom (3756B_0006)
yeah (3756B_0009)
show you that one too then (3756B_0010)
brown one (3756B_0011)
yeah (3756B_0015)
the one that looks like a flood circle (3756B_0016)
yeah (3756B_0019)
yeah (3756B_0022)
 yeah (3756B_0025)
i've heard (3756B_0027)
somebody recently about how you do that when you paint the ceiling you know when you got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that she'd paint that way (3756B_0028)
how you get the edge (3756B_0034)
just have to be real careful (3756B_0036)
we use   two inch brush with  on a slant (3756B_0038)
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes (3756B_0041)
uh-huh (3756B_0042)
well yeah (3756B_0044)
i think i'm going to do it the spring actually (3756B_0045)
they're they're six houses (3756B_0048)
well see the people around the house they  pay for anything like that we do as far as the material (3756B_0049)
there's three houses on the street the same color of yellow out of six houses (3756B_0052)
so i'm thinking i'm going to change it to something (3756B_0054)
the brick is multi color with mostly our tents (3756B_0055)
i think i'm going to put something like a brown on it now so yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the in freeway or something some spoil stand on a little for college a pain (3756B_0058)
yeah (3756B_0064)
there's some columns that could be paid a different color too (3756B_0066)
 did you find your house (3756B_0068)
on the (3756B_0070)
you got to get one of those ladders (3756B_0074)
 yeah (3756B_0077)
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house (3756B_0079)
and that's what he (3756B_0080)
i was out there last week (3756B_0081)
he's finished everything except the gym they (3756B_0082)
yeah (3756B_0088)
yeah i know a house in new mexico it was stuck (3756B_0092)
but when all this trimmed to paint and lots of it (3756B_0093)
and we did basically seventy five percent of the house (3756B_0095)
and then i was afraid to do the way up high and stuff (3756B_0096)
so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid (3756B_0098)
and it came with with his own (3756B_0100)
what do you call those things (3756B_0101)
no (3756B_0103)
where you build like a rafter thing (3756B_0104)
yeah (3756B_0106)
scaffolds (3756B_0107)
he came and did it that way (3756B_0110)
i think he charge me a hundred dollars to finish (3756B_0111)
literally i wouldn't have done it with a scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him or above huge humongous cactus is (3756B_0113)
and if he fell he was dead (3756B_0117)
and he knew that (3756B_0118)
yeah (3756B_0119)
yeah (3756B_0122)
plus it cleaned up my man (3756B_0124)
yeah (3756B_0127)
how much did it cost you too for the pain for them so (3756B_0130)
yeah (3756B_0132)
man that friend of mine that pay his house out there and he went to falls i guess the buys paint (3756B_0138)
and yet he bought like seventeen gallons (3756B_0143)
and anyway he when he checked out there and and he was using his first charge card to they only charging for one gal and paying like thirteen bucks or something (3756B_0145)
and he had he had he had already carried a ladder outside and and tell her that (3756B_0151)
and she run all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the pain (3756B_0154)
so she had to start all over again (3756B_0156)
and he when he got outside he notices thirteen ninety nine or something (3756B_0158)
and he's (3756B_0160)
yeah yeah (3756B_0162)
and it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff (3756B_0163)
i think we're going to do another bad but i think i'll probably just do it or do about the same color no rollers are so messy (3756B_0173)
we never last time anymore (3756B_0174)
well still a paintbrush (3756B_0177)
well the topics about government (3942A_0000)
 i'm not altogether shoe at their pets my best topic uh-huh (3942A_0001)
yeah (3942A_0003)
yeah (3942A_0013)
i i i think that they left a political question was particularly interesting  about    can all on ethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal  because it seems to me that when  government or public service of any kind generates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes  parallel to the legal codes that  we're focusing on the wrong things (3942A_0014)
maybe maybe that's what is happening (3942A_0021)
baby so many things have become public what the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that  it becomes more evidence (3942A_0022)
perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawn making or the results that would be seen and public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that (3942A_0025)
and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons (3942A_0027)
and i couldn't help thinking when that last course it was a funny question during that last part of the question came about how many things can we  actually put a legal code on that  how much i'm sure that they are  prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know (3942A_0029)
that's right (3942A_0040)
yeah (3942A_0042)
i i agree with that and  and also that if the results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing die legitimate means is what you know coming to the public then  then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience (3942A_0049)
and   you know when it becomes public though it become a scandalous (3942A_0057)
that's that's the thing that (3942A_0061)
 things that you don't know  do do not warm their way around and an influence or the people who are perhaps meet other people a stray (3942A_0062)
be able to play all day (3942A_0066)
so i guess you know (3942A_0067)
but as soon as things to get public  there there is that terrible concerned (3942A_0068)
so sometimes i ask myself walk or  people doing that or in the media when somebody you know comes up to office (3942A_0073)
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to take up any kind of thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines (3942A_0076)
it's a very low way of living (3942A_0081)
 so (3942A_0083)
and and and as far as  you know myself having any particular personal knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i'm not terribly involved in it (3942A_0084)
shifting a very (3942A_0086)
and i you know try to do whatever i can i'm a little local area (3942A_0089)
but i it just is not one of the things that i have a place  and a lot of particular time and effort into (3942A_0090)
so i i always feel very outside this kind of  this kind of an issue (3942A_0093)
yeah (3942A_0100)
yeah (3942A_0104)
right (3942A_0105)
yeah (3942A_0107)
i'm not i'm not in there (3942A_0112)
not one of those  you know a volunteer that stared headquarters and whatever  although i admire the people that do that (3942A_0113)
and they certainly do get inside information (3942A_0114)
and  of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their their judgement and they're inside (3942A_0116)
the media inside as you said (3942A_0122)
just kind of read and kind of be a way (3942A_0123)
and then  i don't like to make a whole lot of  judgement myself on less things are so absolutely out of whack that  (3942A_0125)
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and  how many people are self serving (3942B_0002)
i mean you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt and the people aren't self serving (3942B_0006)
i mean that's what i would like to think (3942B_0012)
yeah (3942B_0020)
yeah (3942B_0030)
yeah (3942B_0034)
that makes sense (3942B_0037)
did you start burning peoples private lives ruined their lives as well (3942B_0039)
sometimes you know i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know (3942B_0041)
i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past (3942B_0043)
 sometimes i don't know (3942B_0045)
i think it gets in the where the better (3942B_0047)
i mean just because he did some of the pet doesn't mean he's not going to a person to be a politician (3942B_0048)
but you had them it means is what you know coming to the public and then  then they'll pay for their private life in their own private country  you know when it becomes public though it become a scandal is yeah that's that's the thing that  things that you don't know  do do not warm their way around and an influence on the people who are perhaps lead other people a stray people yeah they do it so i guess you know but the silliest things to get like  there there is that terrible concerns so sometimes i ask myself or  people doing that are in the media  (3942B_0074)
yeah (3942B_0079)
i guess that's what sells newspapers you know (3942B_0080)
roofing   so and and and as far as  you know myself having any particular personal knowledge or insight into politics and politicians it i'm not terribly involved and interesting (3942B_0082)
cursory way i (3942B_0085)
yeah (3942B_0091)
yeah (3942B_0096)
i'm kinda the same way (3942B_0098)
just kinda read the paper follow up on people i mean just you know keep an eye on what's going on (3942B_0099)
i don't really play an active role in any kind of boston (3942B_0106)
and  of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with the right thing (3942B_0115)
right (3942B_0117)
the media inside as you said i just kind of read and kind of be a way off yeah (3942B_0121)
yeah (3942B_0124)
now (3994A_0003)
plenty (3994A_0004)
i used to (3994A_0005)
i think everybody took piano lessons (3994A_0007)
uh-huh (3994A_0008)

so i never tried again (3994A_0105)
yeah (3994A_0113)
i never really learned the music or anything (3994A_0117)
i got two hours figuring out while the keys were on the piano (3994A_0119)
and that's about when i quit (3994A_0120)
yeah (3994A_0124)

i i enjoyed the music (3994B_0032)
it gives me an hour (3994B_0033)
and i always found (3994B_0035)
from  playing the piano and when i was depressed and they didn't have anything else to do and there's no one to play with i could always go play with the piano you know (3994B_0036)
so how long did you play (3994B_0040)

but (3994B_0080)
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music i was memorizing music (3994B_0082)
and so because of that i can't read music as well i used to (3994B_0083)
anyway (3994B_0084)
but i i enjoy (3994B_0087)
i find that  (3994B_0088)
i still enjoy the marching band (3994B_0089)
i still enjoy  thinking in the choir (3994B_0090)
yeah (3994B_0093)
yeah (3994B_0096)
yeah (3994B_0097)
that's (3994B_0098)

that's pretty good (3994B_0114)
well (3994B_0116)

but after one semester left and no no (3994B_0125)

and besides that i could learn i wasn't really that good (3994B_0131)
i gave up (3994B_0133)
because my mom thought it was (3994B_0135)
