how do you feel about the vietnam war (sw4004A_0001)
yeah (sw4004A_0006)
i saw that as well (sw4004A_0007)
well  were you over and vietnam (sw4004A_0016)
yeah (sw4004A_0017)
i'm i was much (sw4004A_0023)
i was born in sixty seven (sw4004A_0024)
yeah (sw4004A_0025)
 both my well both my brothers were  draft age (sw4004A_0027)
but now they're in the morning going over which i think they were very happy for (sw4004A_0028)
yeah (sw4004A_0033)
 so well do you feel that it was worth what we did over there (sw4004A_0037)
 do you think i mean do you think  invest the investment lives and money was worth it (sw4004A_0044)
i'd probably agree with that (sw4004A_0047)
what effects do you think it's had in our country (sw4004A_0050)
i think that and that's pretty typical of the into our entire involvement over there and that you know nothing was really address (sw4004A_0058)
it wasn't you know it was never (sw4004A_0059)
we we had an ounce that we were going to war (sw4004A_0060)
it was just such a gradual in subtle you know they  you know increase minute of force (sw4004A_0061)
they glare you remember we  we had a we had a  spy ship poor pete it or something (sw4004A_0066)
so  do you do you think that like our  for example like in in the past where the persian gulf war that  (sw4004A_0074)
it seemed to me that that bush was going going to extraordinary links to  you know prepare of the country for war (sw4004A_0075)
okay (sw4004A_0079)
i wasn't really keeping town (sw4004A_0083)
but i guess (sw4004A_0084)
well  you know i guess it's pretty deep feelings  (sw4004B_0002)
i just  went back and rented  the movie was it good morning vietnam (sw4004B_0003)
and  (sw4004B_0005)
got that   some insight they're that they're kind of help me put together the feelings (sw4004B_0008)
really appreciated the the little  english class where the  the  feller just wouldn't do it (sw4004B_0009)
the guy's guides gouge in your eyes (sw4004B_0010)
what are you going to do (sw4004B_0011)
wait for him to punish me off (sw4004B_0013)
and  it it was a good to remember the  that that kind of  asian philosophy (sw4004B_0014)
no (sw4004B_0018)
no (sw4004B_0019)
kind of in in between (sw4004B_0020)
finally drew a high draft number (sw4004B_0021)
and you (sw4004B_0022)
well i personally  you know  i just went in limbo (sw4004B_0029)
i had a passport and was ready to go or   out of the country are are joined special forces (sw4004B_0030)
either one (sw4004B_0031)
i mean i i just didn't (sw4004B_0035)
so  (sw4004B_0036)
yeah (sw4004B_0038)
the second (sw4004B_0039)
sure (sw4004B_0042)
well mark  what was that again (sw4004B_0043)
no (sw4004B_0045)
nah not really (sw4004B_0046)
downside   well (sw4004B_0051)
robert as we should   yeah go into the grief that sits there and (sw4004B_0052)
you know where our presidents have always avoided that has their country (sw4004B_0053)
so it's pretty serious really  (sw4004B_0055)
lot of things that aren't being address (sw4004B_0056)
yeah (sw4004B_0062)
golf a time can  resolution (sw4004B_0063)
was it a dolphin or a (sw4004B_0064)
you remember that (sw4004B_0065)
yeah (sw4004B_0067)
yeah (sw4004B_0068)
we only it was (sw4004B_0069)
 finally president johnson's said well they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin torpedoed (sw4004B_0070)
isn't that something (sw4004B_0072)
pay market i've gotta go  (sw4004B_0077)
well  see (sw4004B_0080)
i guess for five minutes are up according to (sw4004B_0081)
do you (sw4004B_0082)
yeah (sw4004B_0086)
okay (sw4004B_0087)
bye bye (sw4004B_0088)
do you have a p c (sw4008A_0001)
one of my friends are in a macintosh (sw4008A_0006)
they  p c my a i b m p c myself (sw4008A_0007)
the two eighty six (sw4008A_0009)
probably eventually going to get a three eighty six (sw4008A_0010)
 mostly  word processing applications and  just as a dumb terminal (sw4008A_0013)
 but i  i think eventually i'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that (sw4008A_0015)
 what do you find did you use yours mostly (sw4008A_0016)
now (sw4008A_0026)
i think i'm planning on moving out of getting a three eighty six before i move up the windows although you know i do like the the user environment (sw4008A_0027)
yeah (sw4008A_0031)
uh-huh (sw4008A_0032)
yeah well it's nice i just i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose and also like a macintosh (sw4008A_0033)
yeah (sw4008A_0040)
that's what i learned a lot of languages on with an apple two e my high school (sw4008A_0041)
yeah (sw4008A_0043)
what do you use your computer for  just things around the house or in the (sw4008A_0047)
let's see what do you do (sw4008A_0049)
wow (sw4008A_0051)
 and there are these like do these programs  (sw4008A_0052)
 they based on  on a on a  other language (sw4008A_0053)
are they based in or are they (sw4008A_0054)
a lot of the  there are a lot of the the english as a second language classes they'll have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world (sw4008A_0055)
and the teacher just tries to try to teach english or you know through natural understanding (sw4008A_0056)
 just  when i was in high school i worked for the communities (sw4008A_0060)
and they had a english second language (sw4008A_0061)
i always seem strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke english not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time (sw4008A_0062)
a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many q (sw4008A_0064)
you can't do any of hand gestures and things like that (sw4008A_0065)
to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that (sw4008A_0074)
i imagine so (sw4008A_0084)
 so  what were you doing when you're using an apple two e (sw4008A_0085)
it's (sw4008A_0089)
yes (sw4008A_0091)
it's amazing how how like in the general user community the expectations of just grown so much (sw4008A_0092)
number my first computer was a terrorist eighty with four k on it (sw4008A_0093)
you know you know then then i then i started playing with apples you know (sw4008A_0095)
yeah those had forty eight (sw4008A_0096)
you know if if they were really great they had sixty four k (sw4008A_0097)
 i know i know that my school they had a bunch of had sixteen k on them (sw4008A_0099)
i remember that there was one game that i play that required forty eight (sw4008A_0102)
and there's only one computer that had forty u._k. on it at the time (sw4008A_0103)
it's just amazing that generally you know if you've phew (sw4008A_0105)
i'm not sure about  macintoshes (sw4008A_0106)
by noon i b m's you generally you know you buy a megabyte at the time (sw4008A_0107)
yeah that's that's your lower that's the low end (sw4008A_0109)
yeah (sw4008A_0117)
yes (sw4008B_0002)
i have a mackintosh i see thirty (sw4008B_0003)
what do you use your square mostly (sw4008B_0012)
well i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and database (sw4008B_0017)
and  the only thing (sw4008B_0018)
i'm  i'm just starting to get into a little bit more communications (sw4008B_0019)
just  today order to fax modem (sw4008B_0020)
so i'll be able to center see faxes right over there without using (sw4008B_0021)
you don't have to make it hard copy that way (sw4008B_0023)
or using windows (sw4008B_0025)
uh-huh (sw4008B_0028)
uh-huh (sw4008B_0029)
well it gave me more and more like a macintosh (sw4008B_0030)
well the one thing i used to use (sw4008B_0036)
i've never used an i b m actually (sw4008B_0037)
to use a snapple to eat which of course is looks pretty primitive now (sw4008B_0038)
but i don't have any  any real programming capabilities on my a mac right now (sw4008B_0042)
i don't have any compilers (sw4008B_0044)
so i'm (sw4008B_0046)
 he's in my business (sw4008B_0048)
i  do  consultation and and testing of various kinds for  english as a second language programs (sw4008B_0050)
that's exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly (sw4008B_0057)
seem to be a better informed an average person on that (sw4008B_0059)
right (sw4008B_0066)
well now we  (sw4008B_0067)
what i use a computer for us to write materials that are later printed (sw4008B_0068)
most of the stuff that i do is not  interactive (sw4008B_0070)
and i use it for  data analysis on testing (sw4008B_0072)
yeah (sw4008B_0073)
well just actually just  item analysis statistical analysis of the tests (sw4008B_0075)
you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating while and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is (sw4008B_0078)
to try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort (sw4008B_0081)
so that's involves a lotta spreadsheet use (sw4008B_0082)
well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and was smaller files (sw4008B_0086)
i can't believe you know i've got a five  megabytes on this one now (sw4008B_0087)
and on my two year i had a hundred and twenty eight okay (sw4008B_0090)
yeah (sw4008B_0094)
the old the old apple  the original apple had yeah forty eight a guest and (sw4008B_0098)
my goodness (sw4008B_0101)
uh-huh (sw4008B_0104)
well yeah see thirty goes up to eight (sw4008B_0111)
having upgraded quite that far yet (sw4008B_0113)
probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk (sw4008B_0114)
i don't know (sw4008B_0115)
they say that system seven uses a lot of memory (sw4008B_0116)
okay  do you have any pets (sw4019A_0001)
what kind do you have (sw4019A_0004)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0007)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0008)
well we have a cat (sw4019A_0010)
 he's probably a good two years old big old men sassy tabby (sw4019A_0011)
 that has the disposition of your siamese cats (sw4019A_0013)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0016)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0019)
well yeah (sw4019A_0022)
he's  he has been really aggressive  especially towards my little girl for some reason (sw4019A_0023)
he's  being so mean to her (sw4019A_0025)
we've had him for about two years (sw4019A_0027)
sam and he was so mean to her  right after we first got him (sw4019A_0029)
so we had him neutered and and (sw4019A_0030)
now he bites (sw4019A_0031)
or any more (sw4019A_0032)
right (sw4019A_0034)
yeah (sw4019A_0036)
yeah (sw4019A_0037)
he has a couple of times (sw4019A_0038)
so (sw4019A_0039)
he's a very possessive cats (sw4019A_0041)
he he loves my son (sw4019A_0042)
it's his cat (sw4019A_0043)
and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him (sw4019A_0044)
and he's so funny (sw4019A_0046)
just follows my son around just like a dog (sw4019A_0047)
you won't even let my son shower (sw4019A_0049)
him now and wants to get in the bathroom (sw4019A_0051)
well he showers it's so hilarious (sw4019A_0052)
so he's quite an animal (sw4019A_0053)
yeah (sw4019A_0058)
yeah (sw4019A_0060)
we we did  actually take 'em to the pound a couple of times you know 'cause we just can't have them being shown so aggressive towards that girl (sw4019A_0061)
but  he seems to have mellowed out a little bit (sw4019A_0064)
and we do keep our daughter away from him (sw4019A_0065)
so  (sw4019A_0066)
not for him i said and the cat would not be in this house (sw4019A_0069)
it is (sw4019A_0071)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0072)
we we tried a dog  about four years ago (sw4019A_0073)
and we ended up with   malamute and some other kind of mix (sw4019A_0074)
anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that eight us out of house and home (sw4019A_0075)
so we gave him up and try and (sw4019A_0076)
yes (sw4019A_0078)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0079)
we're in the house (sw4019A_0080)
but we're in a subdivision where we rarely can allow that dog (sw4019A_0081)
we can allow him to rent free (sw4019A_0083)
so he was just chained up all the time (sw4019A_0084)
it was it was unfortunate (sw4019A_0085)
so have you tried any other pets (sw4019A_0087)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0096)
 my word (sw4019A_0097)
 my word (sw4019A_0100)
do they they just paper train it or something (sw4019A_0102)
yeah (sw4019A_0107)
well rabbits are darling (sw4019A_0108)
that would be fun if you could get 'em train (sw4019A_0109)
otherwise they're pretty smelly (sw4019A_0110)
we don't have see we don't have cable (sw4019A_0116)
is that right (sw4019A_0126)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0130)
 that would be interesting to watch (sw4019A_0132)
yes (sw4019A_0134)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0135)
we live out here by (sw4019A_0138)
it's by then (sw4019A_0139)
it's north of salt lake city utah (sw4019A_0140)
and really love it out here (sw4019A_0142)
some kind of country (sw4019A_0143)
we're we're only about ten minutes from ogden (sw4019A_0144)
so we're kind a country but not too (sw4019A_0146)
no no (sw4019A_0148)
uh-huh (sw4019A_0149)
do you (sw4019A_0150)
 well see i'm getting so many calls to texas (sw4019A_0154)
 great (sw4019A_0156)
yeah (sw4019A_0157)
i've been doing it for about two weeks (sw4019A_0158)
 no (sw4019A_0159)
yeah (sw4019B_0002)
i do (sw4019B_0003)
i've got a male siamese about a year old here (sw4019B_0005)
i live alone in an apartment and  except for the cat (sw4019B_0006)
how 'bout you (sw4019B_0009)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0012)
well it's  you know (sw4019B_0014)
just  aggressive by nature (sw4019B_0015)
and  he's been neutered and claw (sw4019B_0017)
so and he's an indoor cat (sw4019B_0018)
so that kind of calms him down for the most part (sw4019B_0020)
how 'bout yours (sw4019B_0021)
and and you say (sw4019B_0026)
yeah (sw4019B_0028)
enough to draw blood (sw4019B_0035)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0040)
yeah (sw4019B_0045)
yeah (sw4019B_0050)
yeah (sw4019B_0054)
yeah (sw4019B_0055)
i guess (sw4019B_0056)
well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess some of the daughter is alright (sw4019B_0057)
when running a carrier off or something (sw4019B_0059)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0062)
sure (sw4019B_0063)
yeah (sw4019B_0067)
yeah (sw4019B_0068)
is that the only pet the gym (sw4019B_0070)
well do you live at you you you in a house or a place where you (sw4019B_0077)
i see (sw4019B_0082)
sure (sw4019B_0086)
no no (sw4019B_0088)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0089)
i live alone in an apartment (sw4019B_0090)
and  it's it's not that big that  (sw4019B_0091)
although i've heard rabbits are pretty good (sw4019B_0093)
you know i i saw something on c n n or on cable here a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments and houses (sw4019B_0095)
and they apparently (sw4019B_0098)
especially when they're young when they bring them in (sw4019B_0099)
i guess (sw4019B_0103)
i guess (sw4019B_0104)
yeah (sw4019B_0105)
and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either (sw4019B_0106)
yeah (sw4019B_0111)
right (sw4019B_0112)
did you see the the c n n the dog show  (sw4019B_0114)
i see (sw4019B_0117)
well they have   then it called the westminster dog show  (sw4019B_0118)
i think it's a new york city at the at the garden (sw4019B_0119)
there once a year alive (sw4019B_0120)
and they had that on last week (sw4019B_0122)
and that's really kinda something to watch (sw4019B_0123)
it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two (sw4019B_0125)
and  some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see (sw4019B_0127)
some of 'em really beautiful too (sw4019B_0129)
so (sw4019B_0131)
so you live in utah (sw4019B_0133)
goodness (sw4019B_0137)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0141)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0145)
well they all work for a t i or (sw4019B_0147)
yeah (sw4019B_0151)
yeah (sw4019B_0152)
yeah (sw4019B_0153)
this is the very first one i've i've talked (sw4019B_0155)
uh-huh (sw4019B_0160)
well  i don't know (sw4022A_0001)
i think the budget is really out of hand right now (sw4022A_0002)
especially in this election year i think that  there ought to be at least some conversation about what we're supposed to do about this (sw4022A_0003)
right (sw4022A_0007)
right (sw4022A_0008)
 well as you said mostly they are token cuts (sw4022A_0009)
especially what for instance george bush is offering (sw4022A_0010)
yeah (sw4022A_0013)
ninety seven cents a week (sw4022A_0014)
what (sw4022A_0015)
that's really not going to do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know (sw4022A_0016)
another ninety seven cents (sw4022A_0018)
you can buy a coke or something for that (sw4022A_0019)
yeah (sw4022A_0023)
ninety seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either (sw4022A_0026)
i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either (sw4022A_0028)
especially the democratic candidates  don't seem to be coming up with much that really spark my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point (sw4022A_0029)
i believe it was (sw4022A_0033)
but i (sw4022A_0036)
yeah (sw4022A_0038)
i mean that's better than george bush you came out and said no (sw4022A_0039)
i will not (sw4022A_0040)
my lips or whatever (sw4022A_0042)
and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know like i can't follow through on this (sw4022A_0043)
it seems to me that  that the budget is so out of hand (sw4022A_0046)
and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over (sw4022A_0047)
we're supposed to be getting a piece dividend of you know x number of billion trillion dollars a year (sw4022A_0048)
well i'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go (sw4022A_0050)
because in my opinion i don't think i'm ever going to see any of this peace so called (sw4022A_0051)
i mean if they could actually put something together and make (sw4022A_0055)
i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either 'cause i feel that they waste money also (sw4022A_0056)
but with this piece dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works projects like they had in the thirties or whatever (sw4022A_0058)
right (sw4022A_0062)
 exactly (sw4022A_0063)
and that way we could really focus on building structure of the country (sw4022A_0066)
yeah (sw4022A_0070)
and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure (sw4022A_0071)
and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now (sw4022A_0072)
so am i (sw4022A_0079)
uh-huh (sw4022A_0085)
right (sw4022A_0091)
right (sw4022A_0095)
uh-huh (sw4022A_0097)
right (sw4022A_0098)
you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington (sw4022A_0100)
yeah (sw4022A_0102)
well it's it's more no (sw4022A_0103)
a loaded tennis (sw4022A_0104)
i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year (sw4022A_0105)
in my opinion don't do very responsible job spending that money (sw4022A_0107)
 no (sw4022A_0111)
for the for the moment (sw4022A_0114)
and that's what really is getting me about what george bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i'm going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come november and you'll elect me again (sw4022A_0115)
and then i'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said (sw4022A_0118)
or you know it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference (sw4022A_0120)
no (sw4022A_0125)
not at all (sw4022A_0127)
uh-huh (sw4022A_0129)
yeah (sw4022B_0005)
seems to me you know that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it when it's just such a bad time for it (sw4022B_0006)
yeah (sw4022B_0011)
the ninety seven cents a week (sw4022B_0012)
nothing it's just not actually a gate gate (sw4022B_0021)
just the cutting the withholding the amount withheld (sw4022B_0022)
hum (sw4022B_0024)
you just don't see it changing my lifestyle a whole lot (sw4022B_0025)
yeah (sw4022B_0031)
i mean in retrospect  was it was that said you know i'll tell you right now i'm going to raise taxes (sw4022B_0032)
yeah (sw4022B_0035)
i have a lot more respect your (sw4022B_0037)
yeah (sw4022B_0041)
 yeah (sw4022B_0052)
yeah (sw4022B_0054)
yeah (sw4022B_0057)
yeah (sw4022B_0060)
yeah i i think that'd be a great idea you know like the conservation corps (sw4022B_0061)
would you and it would help on appointment greatly (sw4022B_0064)
and it's (sw4022B_0065)
instructors and is it (sw4022B_0068)
we've we herself incredibly over the last fifty years of the cold war (sw4022B_0069)
hum (sw4022B_0074)
i agree totally (sw4022B_0075)
 but anyways it just it just seems so yeah so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen (sw4022B_0076)
 i i'm in college right now (sw4022B_0077)
yeah (sw4022B_0078)
where'd you go (sw4022B_0081)
i go to georgia tech (sw4022B_0084)
and you know (sw4022B_0086)
you know they're required political science class a couple of years ago (sw4022B_0088)
and one of the things we discussed was you know we're we're the budget situate how the buddies situation just got so out of hand (sw4022B_0090)
and what happened was (sw4022B_0092)
i think it was like in in the  eighty one  (sw4022B_0093)
reagan basically said you know i'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the taxpayers and this is ludicrous budget that he knew that that  that the congress would not in the right mine passed (sw4022B_0094)
con congress realizing that they were going to lose a congress realize that they were going to lose a propaganda or you know by by by removing the tax cut further cut the taxes and creative you know that that you know in created the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit (sw4022B_0096)
and you just (sw4022B_0099)
i mean it's just like playing chicken with a loaded gun (sw4022B_0101)
yeah (sw4022B_0106)
yeah (sw4022B_0109)
what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're going to to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting left (sw4022B_0110)
i mean it's kinda like a room and the bread and circuses thing you know or or people just want want to have you know whatever will make them feel good right now (sw4022B_0113)
yeah (sw4022B_0122)
i mean i don't know (sw4022B_0123)
i i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninety seven cents a week (sw4022B_0124)
don't think it was a well thought out and said (sw4022B_0128)
martin how do you feel about crime in the city (sw4023A_0001)
you said you're from atlanta (sw4023A_0002)
i mean do you find crime in atlanta (sw4023A_0008)
and also (sw4023A_0009)
what do you think can be done about the crime in the city (sw4023A_0017)
that probably agree with that (sw4023A_0022)
yeah (sw4023A_0029)
that's probably true (sw4023A_0030)
 so  what do you think it lends as bad as most other cities (sw4023A_0031)
i don't think it's bad l a either (sw4023A_0038)
i don't think we don't we have as much as the gang problem there's a lot of the other cities have (sw4023A_0040)
yeah (sw4023A_0049)
i've been to the to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in the downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of it's just just keeping your senses about you and and trying not to look like a victim (sw4023A_0051)
you know walk walk with with necessarily but just walking or confidently (sw4023A_0054)
you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are (sw4023A_0057)
yeah (sw4023A_0063)
yeah (sw4023A_0070)
have you ever been mugged in atlanta (sw4023A_0071)
yeah (sw4023A_0084)
been pretty lucky about getting mugged (sw4023A_0085)
hello (sw4023A_0086)
i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun (sw4023A_0088)
and it's been about the only real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta (sw4023A_0090)
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just rob (sw4023A_0093)
 really (sw4023A_0097)
 where was that (sw4023A_0099)
well that downtown (sw4023A_0100)
really (sw4023A_0104)
metropolitan (sw4023A_0107)
yeah (sw4023A_0108)
i'm actually i've known some people that have had their car stolen (sw4023A_0111)
 and that and and and he about half the time they seem to the a p d seems to recover them you know in various states are disrepair up on blocks (sw4023A_0112)
a friend who had a  he w rabbit (sw4023A_0115)
and when he when he got it back his  dashboard was sitting in the industry (sw4023A_0116)
you know you're probably luckier than (sw4023A_0123)
 sort of like insurance pay for the body damage (sw4023A_0127)
was that that all of his buddies (sw4023A_0128)
so how do you know this much about  stealing cars (sw4023A_0139)
right (sw4023B_0003)
 actually i live in the city (sw4023B_0004)
and  i guess it is a concern of mine  you know for my own safety (sw4023B_0006)
that's right (sw4023B_0010)
  i think it is bad in certain areas (sw4023B_0011)
however i think  the area that i live in it's not the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the city (sw4023B_0013)
i think it seems that there's certain areas where  the crime is focused (sw4023B_0015)
well i think it's what's been happening in the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrol trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility (sw4023B_0018)
and  it had some impact but not a tremendous amount (sw4023B_0019)
and probably  they need to try to increase community involvement and that sort of thing i think's (sw4023B_0021)
yeah (sw4023B_0023)
you know particularly in some of the housing projects  you know that's that tends to be where a lot of the crime is focused (sw4023B_0025)
and they've got to be more than just having having cops (sw4023B_0027)
we had a kind of changed the way people think about it (sw4023B_0028)
 well i've been in this (sw4023B_0032)
i'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime (sw4023B_0033)
 it's nowhere near as bad as new york city for example (sw4023B_0034)
probably not not as bad as detroit (sw4023B_0036)
no (sw4023B_0039)
yeah (sw4023B_0041)
that seems to be true (sw4023B_0042)
hum (sw4023B_0043)
if you've ever been to like new york city (sw4023B_0044)
and you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes committed (sw4023B_0045)
so that obvious (sw4023B_0048)
yeah (sw4023B_0052)
that's true (sw4023B_0053)
with the big (sw4023B_0055)
yeah (sw4023B_0056)
right (sw4023B_0058)
sure (sw4023B_0059)
right (sw4023B_0060)
don't won't walk down  an ally (sw4023B_0061)
don't get (sw4023B_0062)
try to keep yourself out of a bad situation (sw4023B_0064)
yeah (sw4023B_0066)
there are times when you can avoid all that (sw4023B_0067)
and and then you're kind of on your own (sw4023B_0069)
 no (sw4023B_0072)
the only thing i've ever had i've had my wallet lifting (sw4023B_0073)
but that was in a more of a a a setting where there was a number of people around (sw4023B_0075)
i kinda got (sw4023B_0076)
i was much younger at the time (sw4023B_0077)
and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really and kinda passed it off so i didn't know who had it (sw4023B_0079)
i've had that happen (sw4023B_0082)
that's that's about it (sw4023B_0083)
 yeah (sw4023B_0087)
really (sw4023B_0091)
well i've had my (sw4023B_0092)
i've had my car stolen (sw4023B_0095)
so maybe that counts (sw4023B_0096)
yeah (sw4023B_0098)
yeah (sw4023B_0102)
that was in the northern  up near crumbling mall area (sw4023B_0103)
sexually cobb county (sw4023B_0105)
but it is atlanta (sw4023B_0106)
and  that's a lot of car theft and that area (sw4023B_0109)
right (sw4023B_0113)
yeah (sw4023B_0117)
mine was just it had been wrecked (sw4023B_0118)
in some superficial type damage (sw4023B_0119)
but they didn't they didn't strip (sw4023B_0120)
so i got it back (sw4023B_0122)
yeah (sw4023B_0124)
most (sw4023B_0125)
right (sw4023B_0129)
yeah it was about three grand to put everything together (sw4023B_0130)
correct the steering call them of course to steal the car (sw4023B_0131)
you gotta you crack the steering called (sw4023B_0133)
and he pulled it (sw4023B_0134)
there was a p._i._n. in there that you can pull on these g m cars (sw4023B_0135)
and you can started up basically pretty easily (sw4023B_0137)
well after i found mine i had to had to (sw4023B_0140)
how's your product (sw4026A_0001)
i hear that one (sw4026A_0004)
have you had any lately i go out (sw4026A_0005)
 wow (sw4026A_0012)
so you didn't get anything (sw4026A_0015)
all the all the warranty israel (sw4026A_0016)
you're kidding (sw4026A_0023)
yeah (sw4026A_0025)
we just moved into a new house too (sw4026A_0026)
so we had to buy all those too (sw4026A_0027)
yeah (sw4026A_0029)
i think i've had problems with the  (sw4026A_0030)
by a lot of woodworking equipment through the mail (sw4026A_0031)
and i bought this paint stripped or where they advertise and it's non toxic and such (sw4026A_0033)
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings (sw4026A_0034)
so  (sw4026A_0035)
i didn't return i because it probably costs me more than (sw4026A_0037)
i just ended up using it (sw4026A_0038)
but that's about the only thing i have had gone wrong (sw4026A_0039)
that's incredible (sw4026A_0045)
and they all went out of the same time (sw4026A_0050)
today (sw4026A_0052)
wow (sw4026A_0053)
wow (sw4026A_0061)
frustrating (sw4026A_0062)
uh-huh (sw4026A_0065)
uh-huh (sw4026A_0069)
they go out a lot (sw4026A_0070)
yeah (sw4026A_0078)
see i'm in the manufacturing phil (sw4026A_0079)
home from work (sw4026A_0080)
and make a model model their bags of safety airbags (sw4026A_0081)
yeah (sw4026A_0083)
that more of an international (sw4026A_0085)
and i think (sw4026A_0086)
well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment (sw4026A_0087)
we test everything after each assembly process (sw4026A_0088)
and so our testing is pretty thorough (sw4026A_0089)
but (sw4026A_0090)
 the tests (sw4026A_0096)
well we test everyone electrical (sw4026A_0097)
we don't (sw4026A_0098)
i think they test  four or five a day actually exploding airbag (sw4026A_0099)
and but we do test after during assembly project product  (sw4026A_0101)
after we assemble each part of the inflate or what explodes the bag we checked to make sure it's there after we install it (sw4026A_0102)
so each assembly process as an inspection right after it's done (sw4026A_0103)
and then we do electrical tests on  during the process (sw4026A_0104)
where they do that all the testing that we have to do through the government (sw4026A_0114)
it's incredible how much testing they have to do (sw4026A_0115)
uh-huh (sw4026A_0119)
 i really haven't had too many problems (sw4026B_0002)
it seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out (sw4026B_0003)
yeah (sw4026B_0006)
had a drier and ice maker a microwave all three (sw4026B_0007)
and they (sw4026B_0008)
unfortunately i bought 'em all three at the same time when i bought my new house (sw4026B_0009)
and  i really don't have any recourse (sw4026B_0010)
so i had to call and have him i'll repaired and (sw4026B_0011)
yeah (sw4026B_0013)
it's a hassle (sw4026B_0014)
yea (sw4026B_0017)
the warranty on the refrigerator (sw4026B_0018)
i (sw4026B_0019)
the refrigerator warranty still good (sw4026B_0020)
but the ice maker itself lasted three years (sw4026B_0021)
and it was three years in two months (sw4026B_0022)
yeah (sw4026B_0024)
 watch out (sw4026B_0028)
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances (sw4026B_0041)
but i just (sw4026B_0042)
it was within two days it all three of these stopped working (sw4026B_0043)
and  the ice maker was  had avenue  (sw4026B_0044)
and the  microwave had to have some kind of something i can't even pronounce (sw4026B_0046)
yeah (sw4026B_0047)
dry or had to have a neighbor heating element (sw4026B_0048)
so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them (sw4026B_0049)
 within two days of each other (sw4026B_0051)
i was (sw4026B_0054)
it wasn't a good way (sw4026B_0055)
that was pretty man (sw4026B_0056)
and plus the place that i bought the mall had gone out of business (sw4026B_0057)
so even if  i think even if i had  had kept them warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured (sw4026B_0058)
but still they went through that retailer (sw4026B_0059)
so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer and on (sw4026B_0060)
i didn't have to worry about all of that because they weren't under warranty (sw4026B_0063)
and it was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fix them (sw4026B_0064)
but (sw4026B_0066)
the only other things that i've ever had trouble with  (sw4026B_0067)
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric herder are (sw4026B_0068)
yeah (sw4026B_0071)
i've had two or three of those go out (sw4026B_0072)
one was under warranty (sw4026B_0073)
and the other two one (sw4026B_0074)
but i just (sw4026B_0075)
other than that you know t v's and things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with (sw4026B_0076)
i don't think products are getting much better though (sw4026B_0077)
 really (sw4026B_0082)
that's interesting (sw4026B_0084)
do you do test each individual one (sw4026B_0091)
do you just test (sw4026B_0093)
like if you've got ten you test one (sw4026B_0094)
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine or okay (sw4026B_0095)
well that's something i've never had to use (sw4026B_0106)
never i've never been involved in an automobile accident (sw4026B_0107)
 luckily that's a product that i haven't had the test (sw4026B_0108)
but i think it's a great idea (sw4026B_0110)
yeah (sw4026B_0111)
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about (sw4026B_0112)
but (sw4026B_0113)
 i'm sure they want to be thorough (sw4026B_0116)
but even (sw4026B_0117)
i don't mind spending the extra money on the car if you know even if they passed a saving the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing (sw4026B_0118)
i'm not a real big seat belt (sw4026B_0120)
my  (sw4026B_0121)
okay (sw4028A_0001)
 i guess we're going to talk describe a job benefits (sw4028A_0002)
and so what do you think  next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits (sw4028A_0003)
 does your company have good benefits in that in that regard (sw4028A_0007)
uh-huh (sw4028A_0011)
 well i'm (sw4028A_0022)
my medical coverage is what's an h m o (sw4028A_0023)
 so that's in my opinion that's getting as bordering on a health clinic (sw4028A_0025)
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage (sw4028A_0026)
right (sw4028A_0039)
yes (sw4028A_0042)
that's right (sw4028A_0043)
i'm fairly young myself (sw4028A_0045)
only been (sw4028A_0046)
when i first started working which (sw4028A_0047)
three years ago is when i first got into full time employee (sw4028A_0048)
and at that time i immediately joined the h m o (sw4028A_0050)
i never really (sw4028A_0051)
so the only i've kind of consistently has been through the h m o (sw4028A_0052)
and  you know for me it's worked out real good (sw4028A_0053)
yeah (sw4028A_0062)
yeah (sw4028A_0066)
 like you you mentioned you worked for a school system (sw4028A_0067)
worked for  georgia tech in the research branch (sw4028A_0068)
and i guess another one that that that i rank up there kind of job flexibility in time off  i enjoy as a as a benefit (sw4028A_0070)
right (sw4028A_0074)
getting a lot of lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation (sw4028A_0077)
right (sw4028A_0092)
well  i'm not actually on the teaching faculty (sw4028A_0094)
but we have a large research organization associated with the university (sw4028A_0095)
and that's who i work with (sw4028A_0096)
and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility and what we do (sw4028A_0098)
we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study (sw4028A_0099)
right (sw4028A_0103)
yeah (sw4028A_0114)
are there any things that that you'd like to see a change in terms of the the best (sw4028A_0117)
well i would say the medical  group insurance  area as far as  covering medical costs for yourself or family members (sw4028B_0004)
i work for a a public school system district (sw4028B_0010)
and  so it's different than a company where most companies find almost the entire thing (sw4028B_0012)
the school district does  the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of  cost (sw4028B_0013)
overall  i've been pleased with it over the years (sw4028B_0015)
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district it had to alter  you know change companies (sw4028B_0017)
now we're on a managed care thing which is stressed a lot of people out although it has not disturbed me any (sw4028B_0018)
how 'bout yourself (sw4028B_0021)
uh-huh (sw4028B_0024)
right (sw4028B_0027)
yeah (sw4028B_0028)
our district did that for the ninety one and the ninety school year are talented (sw4028B_0030)
and i was in the h m o (sw4028B_0031)
and  i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for (sw4028B_0032)
they usually sign a contract or something (sw4028B_0033)
and   i did have surgery last summer (sw4028B_0035)
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first (sw4028B_0036)
i've never seen another bill (sw4028B_0037)
so i i have to say it really works (sw4028B_0038)
but again i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it (sw4028B_0040)
if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people (sw4028B_0041)
uh-huh (sw4028B_0049)
right (sw4028B_0055)
you have a family and and  everybody's gone to a different doctors  it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history (sw4028B_0056)
you feel comfortable with (sw4028B_0057)
i'm sure it would be very stressful (sw4028B_0059)
my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay (sw4028B_0060)
you can continue to go to your own doctor (sw4028B_0061)
your benefits are not as you know good (sw4028B_0063)
so (sw4028B_0064)
alright (sw4028B_0069)
i do too (sw4028B_0071)
talking about like spring break (sw4028B_0072)
right (sw4028B_0075)
right (sw4028B_0078)
it really  (sw4028B_0079)
i don't think most of our teachers (sw4028B_0080)
i'm not a teacher (sw4028B_0081)
i am the  secretarial executive assistant (sw4028B_0082)
but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress off all year long frankly (sw4028B_0083)
it is just texas has really  (sw4028B_0085)
they want everybody educated no matter what it costs (sw4028B_0086)
 and it it would be just (sw4028B_0087)
we all look forward to (sw4028B_0088)
in two weeks we have spring break (sw4028B_0089)
and i don't know who looks forward to it more of the students or the other teachers and right now (sw4028B_0090)
what do you do there (sw4028B_0093)
okay (sw4028B_0097)
that's good (sw4028B_0100)
i would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day yeah little lukewarm or something (sw4028B_0102)
and  you know it's good that they allow you that (sw4028B_0104)
say the school (sw4028B_0107)
so we do have to work you know the day (sw4028B_0108)
but we do get many days off (sw4028B_0109)
and  we all look forward to it (sw4028B_0110)
that's the only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college (sw4028B_0112)
but at the time i worked there because my hours and days where the same as theirs (sw4028B_0113)
and  i've just continue to  stay there (sw4028B_0116)
okay (sw4032A_0001)
do you do any exercise (sw4032A_0002)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0007)
 so those are more or less indoor sports (sw4032A_0008)
how's the weather out there in georgia (sw4032A_0009)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0013)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0018)
well yeah (sw4032A_0020)
i'm on an exercise program (sw4032A_0021)
i'm writing my errol dined bike  half an hour every morning (sw4032A_0022)
i'm just about ready to up to forty five minutes in the morning (sw4032A_0024)
and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the wintertime (sw4032A_0025)
it's kinda kept me from getting cabin fever and  and it seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise (sw4032A_0026)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0031)
first of all i'd like to get my weight (sw4032A_0032)
i'm about fifty pounds overweight (sw4032A_0033)
and so i'd like to get the weight off (sw4032A_0034)
and then i'd really like to get into that (sw4032A_0035)
and  we have my husband and i have   aerobics video and it's called the firm (sw4032A_0037)
i don't know if you've heard of it (sw4032A_0038)
but it's an aerobics video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down (sw4032A_0039)
that you're using weights (sw4032A_0040)
and that is the most incredible aerobics workout i ever (sw4032A_0041)
it's really fun (sw4032A_0042)
yes (sw4032A_0046)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0047)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0049)
yeah (sw4032A_0050)
 no (sw4032A_0053)
yes (sw4032A_0054)
i am (sw4032A_0055)
but i i've never done it myself (sw4032A_0056)
have you done that (sw4032A_0057)
big thing  (sw4032A_0064)
so how is that (sw4032A_0068)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0077)
yeah (sw4032A_0078)
from playing basketball (sw4032A_0081)
are your needs (sw4032A_0082)
do you have healthy knees (sw4032A_0083)
 dear (sw4032A_0086)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0089)
 that's good (sw4032A_0091)
that sounds it sounds just like my husband (sw4032A_0092)
he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball (sw4032A_0093)
and i always just add a heck of a time getting that ankle helping (sw4032A_0095)
so that's what he does (sw4032A_0098)
see where it says his bracing as high tops (sw4032A_0099)
yeah (sw4032A_0100)
shoot (sw4032A_0105)
wow (sw4032A_0108)
uh-huh (sw4032A_0109)
is amazing how fast you take off the inches (sw4032A_0113)
and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week (sw4032A_0115)
and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video  and then the bike on the other day (sw4032A_0116)
that is really amazing how fast inches come off (sw4032A_0118)
and the muscle built real fast (sw4032A_0119)
 you can start (sw4032A_0121)
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month (sw4032A_0122)
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and they build up to your  twenty five pound them though (sw4032A_0123)
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video (sw4032A_0125)
it's an hour long video (sw4032A_0126)
it is (sw4032A_0129)
yeah (sw4032A_0130)
i really enjoyed that (sw4032A_0131)
so i'm looking forward to losing this way being farming help (sw4032A_0132)
yeah (sw4032A_0136)
yes (sw4032A_0137)
now this winter's been quite mild (sw4032A_0138)
 we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground (sw4032A_0139)
it was quite chili but not (sw4032A_0140)
yeah (sw4032B_0003)
i do (sw4032B_0004)
 i like to  play basketball and weightlifting (sw4032B_0005)
those are probably the two main things that i like to do (sw4032B_0006)
yeah (sw4032B_0010)
 in the winter it's typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis (sw4032B_0011)
 i like to play tennis in the summertime are in the spring and fall (sw4032B_0012)
but in the winter it's gets pretty cold (sw4032B_0014)
 yeah (sw4032B_0016)
so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter (sw4032B_0017)
 how 'bout yourself (sw4032B_0019)
right (sw4032B_0028)
do you  do any anaerobic type weightlifting or weight training type thing (sw4032B_0029)
yeah (sw4032B_0044)
it's it's a it's similar to aerobics with weights (sw4032B_0045)
but it's like low impact aerobics weights (sw4032B_0048)
okay (sw4032B_0051)
are you familiar with  step or bench aerobics (sw4032B_0052)
yes (sw4032B_0058)
yeah (sw4032B_0059)
in atlanta that's  (sw4032B_0060)
most of the health clubs are all (sw4032B_0061)
that's the that's the thing (sw4032B_0063)
at first it was just regular aerobics (sw4032B_0065)
now venture step aerobics of kinda taking over (sw4032B_0066)
 it they call it a low impact aerobics (sw4032B_0069)
and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time (sw4032B_0070)
from what i've done it it does give you a good a real good workout (sw4032B_0072)
but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know (sw4032B_0073)
movement of going up on the step (sw4032B_0074)
that could create a problem (sw4032B_0075)
they seem to think that it won't (sw4032B_0079)
you never know (sw4032B_0080)
yeah (sw4032B_0084)
i i think my ankles probably mowing weak point (sw4032B_0085)
but i've i've kind of taking care of that (sw4032B_0087)
we're high tops and then also on an  support ankle brace which is very stiff (sw4032B_0088)
and  wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so (sw4032B_0090)
yeah (sw4032B_0094)
yeah (sw4032B_0096)
yeah (sw4032B_0097)
yeah (sw4032B_0102)
did i injured month so many times rehabilitate ing became quite easy (sw4032B_0103)
it would only take three or four days (sw4032B_0106)
and i could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself and play that way (sw4032B_0107)
but  so how how successful is your exercise videos (sw4032B_0112)
uh-huh (sw4032B_0114)
that's a good workout (sw4032B_0128)
in the winter i guess there's a lot of (sw4032B_0134)
it's quite cold and snow (sw4032B_0135)
so how do you get most of your current event information (sw4033A_0001)
uh-huh (sw4033A_0004)
right (sw4033A_0007)
i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things (sw4033A_0011)
to keep up on what's going on (sw4033A_0012)
yeah (sw4033A_0015)
right (sw4033A_0018)
well i'm a housewife (sw4033A_0019)
three kids (sw4033A_0020)
so  i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then  talking with people and just hearing what's going on but (sw4033A_0021)
just the regular channels (sw4033A_0026)
this channel i (sw4033A_0027)
that's our channel here (sw4033A_0029)
that's the  i witness news (sw4033A_0030)
so (sw4033A_0032)
 uh-huh (sw4033A_0035)
yeah (sw4033A_0036)
right (sw4033A_0040)
and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not (sw4033A_0041)
basically you know if it can a candidate can get them to follow the news all you know kind of publicized his name (sw4033A_0042)
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it (sw4033A_0046)
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on (sw4033A_0047)
right (sw4033A_0052)
right (sw4033A_0053)
and the news too it just doesn't  cover that many stories (sw4033A_0054)
i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes and you know and and your catastrophes with weather and stuff (sw4033A_0055)
but other than that you really don't know what's going on (sw4033A_0057)
 i will read our current letters that come out on a elections (sw4033A_0059)
i guess i do read that (sw4033A_0060)
and i do steady who's running in our area (sw4033A_0061)
i do study what's going on in the economy (sw4033A_0062)
it you know (sw4033A_0063)
and i guess i do read other magazines  to to get my information (sw4033A_0064)
right (sw4033A_0068)
i used to read every month the reader's digest (sw4033A_0071)
but  now i guess i just have friends that clip article (sw4033A_0073)
fight you know i'm interested in something (sw4033A_0074)
of course during the when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on (sw4033A_0075)
but a lot of the times you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper (sw4033A_0077)
but i just can't seem to find the time (sw4033A_0078)
if they put it out in a video or i'm not a video cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things (sw4033A_0080)
but (sw4033A_0082)
right (sw4033A_0084)
well i  they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of (sw4033A_0086)
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news (sw4033A_0087)
you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas (sw4033A_0088)
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help out what's going on in other countries what you know just more information (sw4033A_0090)
 i guess we'll get pretty good news coverage and a couple of years when you  summer olympics (sw4033A_0094)
i know (sw4033A_0101)
trying to get tickets to it right now (sw4033A_0102)
yeah (sw4033A_0104)
yeah (sw4033A_0107)
right (sw4033A_0112)
right (sw4033A_0113)
yeah (sw4033A_0115)
spend a lotta time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports (sw4033A_0116)
and i think that  that's fine (sw4033A_0117)
i would like to see more time spent on other things (sw4033A_0118)
but (sw4033A_0120)
well see i'm going to school right now (sw4033B_0002)
and  well i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot (sw4033B_0003)
and i don't watch t v as much really either 'cause  my free time it's kind of (sw4033B_0005)
and i do like to do other stuff with it (sw4033B_0006)
and that works sometimes i on the computer network  i read the news sometimes (sw4033B_0008)
and that's kind of helpful (sw4033B_0010)
that's true (sw4033B_0013)
i mean my roommates and stuff you know people around me talk about it (sw4033B_0014)
and the people i work with are pretty you know up to date on that kinda stuff (sw4033B_0016)
uh-huh (sw4033B_0017)
uh-huh (sw4033B_0022)
yeah (sw4033B_0023)
do you watch do you watch the network like major network news (sw4033B_0024)
do you watch like the mcneil era (sw4033B_0025)
 really (sw4033B_0028)
uh-huh (sw4033B_0031)
 see channel where i am  like public t v (sw4033B_0033)
so it's kinda different (sw4033B_0034)
i think i think the  i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks (sw4033B_0037)
like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on (sw4033B_0038)
but  it seems that  they kind of get to throw their opinions and how they you know report on the news (sw4033B_0039)
yeah (sw4033B_0043)
yeah (sw4033B_0044)
exactly (sw4033B_0045)
uh-huh (sw4033B_0048)
because they they can only report on i mean (sw4033B_0049)
they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which just you know to say (sw4033B_0050)
you didn't you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and make probably read something on it (sw4033B_0051)
yeah (sw4033B_0056)
yeah (sw4033B_0058)
what kind of  (sw4033B_0065)
subscribe to like science news (sw4033B_0066)
and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bug me down that i wouldn't know about (sw4033B_0067)
but other than that i don't really (sw4033B_0069)
i don't really subscribed anything else (sw4033B_0070)
uh-huh (sw4033B_0072)
 yeah (sw4033B_0076)
yeah (sw4033B_0079)
yeah (sw4033B_0081)
well i remember back during the  during the war everyone here at work i always had the radio or the t v on 'cause that they were going constantly with that stuff (sw4033B_0083)
and  (sw4033B_0085)
yeah (sw4033B_0089)
that they report it every at the airport at every violent crime in atlanta it would take  probably take the whole news though (sw4033B_0091)
but  (sw4033B_0093)
 yeah (sw4033B_0095)
that's (sw4033B_0096)
they still already they're having like  (sw4033B_0097)
and the newspaper there have a section i think every now and then  on the olympics (sw4033B_0098)
they've got like a count down (sw4033B_0099)
like sixteen hundred days or something (sw4033B_0100)
 really (sw4033B_0103)
that's going to be crazy that time of year (sw4033B_0105)
but  (sw4033B_0106)
i can't believe (sw4033B_0108)
they're stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over (sw4033B_0109)
i guess people want to hear about it (sw4033B_0110)
also big big in the news right now is the braves 'cause there are there and you know spring training or whatever (sw4033B_0111)
and they did so well last year (sw4033B_0114)
yeah (sw4033B_0119)
it seems like (sw4033B_0121)
i don't know (sw4033B_0122)
the way they do the newscast i wish that they kind of separated at you know (sw4033B_0123)
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turned us some channel four (sw4033B_0124)
but i don't have cable (sw4033B_0125)
i think that  one  advantage of having the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't  convict someone who really shouldn't be convicted (sw4036A_0001)
 and i think that you know you're going to animals verdict it helps to ensure that (sw4036A_0003)
i guess  maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that  you  would have a problem  you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted (sw4036A_0004)
have you ever served on a jury before (sw4036A_0006)
 what sorts of cases where they (sw4036A_0010)
so where they criminal or civil (sw4036A_0012)
 okay (sw4036A_0015)
what  what was the verdict (sw4036A_0016)
to the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision (sw4036A_0017)
yeah (sw4036A_0019)
so did it become (sw4036A_0023)
yeah (sw4036A_0025)
but since i was a civil case it really doesn't matter (sw4036A_0029)
you just needed a majority (sw4036A_0030)
what was what was the other case (sw4036A_0032)
that was also several (sw4036A_0033)
yeah (sw4036A_0037)
didn't really (sw4036A_0039)
yeah (sw4036A_0041)
 i'm a college student (sw4036A_0042)
so i haven't been to a jury eligible age for very long (sw4036A_0043)
 and  i did get  once someone's actually at one point (sw4036A_0045)
but i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was a very bad time (sw4036A_0046)
yeah i mean i i really i would like to  to do it at some point  (sw4036A_0049)
but  i i haven't (sw4036A_0050)
one one thing that i i think is  you know maybe is a problem is  i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now (sw4036A_0051)
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases that doesn't work as well (sw4036A_0052)
especially i sort of (sw4036A_0053)
you know (sw4036A_0055)
wow i mean the way that i would think that  but you thought it turned out pretty well (sw4036A_0057)
yeah (sw4036A_0062)
 so it was just kind of a zoo (sw4036A_0065)
and the jurors just sort of (sw4036A_0066)
someone had to figure out what was going on (sw4036A_0067)
 that's interesting (sw4036A_0069)
did it work out pretty well (sw4036A_0070)
did a couple of people gradually sort of assume  sort of a moderator role in the trial (sw4036A_0071)
so or did end up working out pretty well (sw4036A_0076)
the one thing i sometimes wonder about  in civil cases is  whether especially sort of in  maybe like product liability or medical malpractice where there's  sort of a very technical decision to be made some times (sw4036A_0079)
you know it's not just a matter of  of you know did this guy rip off this guy (sw4036A_0081)
it's just a matter when chirping a contract (sw4036A_0082)
sort of a matter of  you know sometimes getting into very technical issues (sw4036A_0083)
and i wonder if  if there's really  if the system works adequately and in educating the jurors about  whatever  you know issue is under discussion (sw4036A_0084)
in the case you were involved and you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind (sw4036A_0086)
yeah (sw4036A_0090)
 so the deal was that he had  borrow money from the bank to buy it (sw4036A_0093)
and you hadn't made the payments (sw4036A_0094)
yeah (sw4036A_0097)
 so there was doing to get back (sw4036A_0100)
yeah (sw4036A_0105)
definitely (sw4036B_0002)
 i have twice (sw4036B_0007)
for a while experience (sw4036B_0009)
they were just you know small town cases where  trailers and banks were involved you know (sw4036B_0011)
they were (sw4036B_0013)
they weren't they weren't any criminal (sw4036B_0014)
 they're it was a i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people (sw4036B_0018)
so it was (sw4036B_0020)
yeah (sw4036B_0021)
and  the one changed his boat that dan (sw4036B_0022)
so it became unanimous no after that turned it in (sw4036B_0024)
and then he changed his mind after they turned it in (sw4036B_0026)
but it then became unanimous (sw4036B_0028)
right (sw4036B_0031)
the  the other case for just traffic (sw4036B_0034)
and you know it was seatbelt law (sw4036B_0036)
and it it didn't even hardly go through (sw4036B_0038)
yeah (sw4036B_0044)
yeah (sw4036B_0047)
you learn a lot going through the juries like that so (sw4036B_0048)
i wouldn't think that that is i mean from from from what i experienced in (sw4036B_0054)
it didn't you know didn't didn't turn out the f planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go (sw4036B_0056)
yeah (sw4036B_0058)
but it was you know (sw4036B_0059)
drew was unorganized (sw4036B_0060)
and it was it just wasn't organized enough for me (sw4036B_0061)
i'm not used to not be an organized (sw4036B_0063)
i just assumed that it would have been (sw4036B_0064)
had to figure out what was going on that's about what it was (sw4036B_0068)
well they picked one person (sw4036B_0074)
and he finally you know moderate it everything and made it turned out the way it should have (sw4036B_0075)
ended up working on (sw4036B_0078)
yeah (sw4036B_0080)
i don't think that they they the educated enough to to really know what's going on (sw4036B_0085)
yeah (sw4036B_0088)
bank pursuing i'm far  because they went to get the the trailer that which was the same with me their property (sw4036B_0089)
it was on his property (sw4036B_0092)
right (sw4036B_0095)
so they came to get (sw4036B_0096)
and then when i came to get it well it was on the landlord property (sw4036B_0098)
and he wouldn't let him take it out (sw4036B_0099)
and that it was a double wide (sw4036B_0101)
that already taken into parts (sw4036B_0102)
so they left it there (sw4036B_0104)
and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it rained and got all in it (sw4036B_0106)
so they were suing him for the money (sw4036B_0108)
and you know there's no way that could because it's it was a moving company (sw4036B_0109)
okay (sw4038A_0001)
i guess it took (sw4038A_0002)
so i guess they're recording it started (sw4038A_0003)
i served (sw4038A_0007)
i was in the air force and served on a court marshall  board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury (sw4038A_0008)
a lot of the same rules apply (sw4038A_0009)
have you ever served on one (sw4038A_0010)
hum (sw4038A_0015)
it's civil or criminal (sw4038A_0019)
uh-huh (sw4038A_0022)
i see (sw4038A_0025)
hum (sw4038A_0031)
 did did the judge  hand down sentences (sw4038A_0032)
did you folks do that (sw4038A_0033)
that's a science in itself (sw4038A_0047)
uh-huh (sw4038A_0052)
i see (sw4038A_0053)
you'd you'd probably be a two puritanical (sw4038A_0054)
yeah (sw4038A_0058)
so  where where the  sentences the judge handed out what you thought to be fair (sw4038A_0062)
yeah (sw4038A_0063)
if you are deciding you think that they would have been different (sw4038A_0064)
wow (sw4038A_0075)
i bet that made them happy (sw4038A_0076)
right (sw4038A_0083)
yeah (sw4038A_0090)
 how many members were on the jury (sw4038A_0091)
six to twelve (sw4038A_0092)
uh-huh (sw4038A_0094)
that's kind of curious to me (sw4038A_0096)
i didn't realize until the  william kennedy smith trial  a few months ago that they had six member juries (sw4038A_0097)
i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak (sw4038A_0098)
but  apparently for some some crimes it's permissible they have six people sitting judgment (sw4038A_0100)
i know on (sw4038A_0102)
getting to this unanimous thing whether you know jerry should be an anniversary and not not in a court marshall case it doesn't require the jury to be an animal (sw4038A_0103)
it's as simple majority rules (sw4038A_0104)
probably on capital (sw4038A_0110)
we weren't we (sw4038A_0112)
the two that are on had to do with drugs (sw4038A_0113)
and  we were a unanimous in  quitting the person even though we in our in our  got felt that the individuals we're both guilty just because of the friends because of various things (sw4038A_0115)
the government really fail to prove its case (sw4038A_0116)
and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove which case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered is proof (sw4038A_0117)
and we had the equipment in both cases (sw4038A_0118)
yeah (sw4038A_0120)
it was yeah in some of the critical things like the offices special investigations at one time  in one of the cases had videotaped this person (sw4038A_0121)
but something happened to the camera and the tape and (sw4038A_0122)
they could do as testify (sw4038A_0124)
yeah (sw4038B_0004)
so have you ever served on a jury (sw4038B_0006)
yeah (sw4038B_0011)
i finally served on one last year (sw4038B_0012)
 been voting for years (sw4038B_0013)
and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called (sw4038B_0014)
and i finally was (sw4038B_0016)
so it was an interesting experience (sw4038B_0017)
kind of boring (sw4038B_0018)
 it was   it was  well let's see it was municipal courts (sw4038B_0020)
so it was a combination of (sw4038B_0023)
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks (sw4038B_0024)
so it was a combination of criminal on several (sw4038B_0026)
and they had  (sw4038B_0027)
most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting knowing the other potential jurors (sw4038B_0028)
it was always always exciting when we got called though to go because then we that we might be able to do something else besides just sit in the jury (sw4038B_0030)
yeah (sw4038B_0034)
judged (sw4038B_0035)
 i  i had a hard time getting seated on a jury (sw4038B_0036)
kept getting (sw4038B_0037)
and i'd be questioned  for him handling the jury (sw4038B_0038)
they kept  this missing me (sw4038B_0039)
course they don't have to give a reason (sw4038B_0042)
but it's just whether the prosecutor and the defence attorney feels like (sw4038B_0043)
they want to get the best  makes for their case (sw4038B_0045)
so they ask what kinds of wild questions (sw4038B_0046)
yeah (sw4038B_0048)
i kept getting called up for drunk driving a question (sw4038B_0049)
and i think part of it was they didn't they didn't like the fact that i don't drink anymore (sw4038B_0050)
that was probably (sw4038B_0057)
although in my case i might have been more sympathetic with a person who got caught (sw4038B_0059)
i don't know (sw4038B_0060)
i was never never there for any sentencing (sw4038B_0065)
i i finally got impaneled on one case   my next to the last day (sw4038B_0066)
and  we got into the  jury room to  decide the case (sw4038B_0067)
and that was one guy on the jury or an ounce to everybody that he doesn't need the deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was  not gilliam he would never vote for guilty (sw4038B_0068)
so are they pointed me journey jury farming (sw4038B_0070)
em i  didn't think that  going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict (sw4038B_0071)
so i told the judge that  we weren't where i'm able to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate (sw4038B_0072)
so the whole thing had to be tried over again (sw4038B_0074)
yeah (sw4038B_0078)
it was  it was funny (sw4038B_0079)
the (sw4038B_0080)
i've i don't know (sw4038B_0081)
i  i didn't   i didn't like not being able to the library (sw4038B_0082)
 i  i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy (sw4038B_0084)
and the other people were kind of mixed (sw4038B_0085)
so well the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again (sw4038B_0087)
cost him a lot of money (sw4038B_0088)
sure (sw4038B_0089)
 it must have been six (sw4038B_0093)
yeah (sw4038B_0095)
yeah (sw4038B_0105)
well let's see (sw4038B_0106)
is it on a capital crime so they have to be unanimous (sw4038B_0108)
uh-huh (sw4038B_0114)
 it was two circumstantial (sw4038B_0119)
drug testing in the workplace (sw4048A_0004)
 i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment (sw4048A_0005)
but that's about it (sw4048A_0006)
i've never had random drug testing (sw4048A_0007)
 really (sw4048A_0011)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0016)
 they do with alcohol (sw4048A_0019)
they do it with alcohol (sw4048A_0021)
 i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine (sw4048A_0025)
 that's interesting (sw4048A_0028)
what type of field or work are you (sw4048A_0031)
illinois a business (sw4048A_0033)
you work in an office around (sw4048A_0036)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0040)
i work in an automotive airbag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars (sw4048A_0042)
and we work around a lot of explosives (sw4048A_0045)
yeah (sw4048A_0047)
so that's you know (sw4048A_0048)
i'm all for it because the while that type of environment i work in you know where they're working with exposes (sw4048A_0049)
and so they could blow up the whole (sw4048A_0050)
well they have safety features with each other and explosives they use (sw4048A_0051)
but still it can be dangerous (sw4048A_0052)
yeah (sw4048A_0057)
now do they fire (sw4048A_0062)
do they (sw4048A_0063)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0069)
 wow (sw4048A_0071)
 that's (sw4048A_0073)
think our policies that (sw4048A_0074)
this is probably the same thing (sw4048A_0075)
and i really sure (sw4048A_0076)
but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance (sw4048A_0082)
but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself (sw4048A_0083)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0089)
do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits (sw4048A_0091)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0095)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0098)
time and just right (sw4048A_0101)
at one employee and i when i was working with you had alcohol and his breath (sw4048A_0105)
and i'm not sure if our policy covers out or not (sw4048A_0106)
that'd be just as dangerous (sw4048A_0107)
uh-huh that's true (sw4048A_0110)
do they give any limits on alcohol (sw4048A_0113)
or is it (sw4048A_0114)
uh-huh (sw4048A_0126)
pretty good (sw4048B_0001)
pretty good (sw4048B_0002)
so we're talking about drug testing in the workplace  (sw4048B_0003)
yeah (sw4048B_0008)
we have random drug testing at in my business (sw4048B_0009)
but i've never been  never had to do it (sw4048B_0010)
yeah (sw4048B_0012)
yeah (sw4048B_0013)
they started that about a year ago (sw4048B_0014)
i think it's mostly for the the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kinda stuff (sw4048B_0015)
but  they they have done some testing runner office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking drinking beer and stuff at lunchtime (sw4048B_0017)
uh-huh (sw4048B_0018)
pardon (sw4048B_0020)
yeah (sw4048B_0022)
yeah (sw4048B_0023)
they'll they'll check for alcohol (sw4048B_0024)
now (sw4048B_0026)
once once you start doing that stuff you're sort of you sort of stuck into  checking for the whole the whole thing (sw4048B_0027)
yeah (sw4048B_0029)
yeah (sw4048B_0030)
and i'm into a business (sw4048B_0032)
yeah (sw4048B_0034)
yeah (sw4048B_0037)
i work in the office (sw4048B_0038)
so  it's pretty pretty safe environment (sw4048B_0039)
uh-huh (sw4048B_0043)
uh-huh (sw4048B_0044)
that sounds like kind of an important job to be a straight on (sw4048B_0046)
yeah (sw4048B_0053)
yeah (sw4048B_0054)
i i i agree (sw4048B_0055)
i think that  you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in a high risk   industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff (sw4048B_0056)
you know (sw4048B_0058)
if it's (sw4048B_0059)
as long as it's not abused  you know random (sw4048B_0060)
as long as it's random in in the individual's rights are  are protected i don't have that big a problem with it (sw4048B_0061)
well see this (sw4048B_0064)
this is where i started having my problem with with my (sw4048B_0065)
worked for a private company (sw4048B_0066)
and the the policy is something like if i can states correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for a company counseling (sw4048B_0067)
but if they catch you if you test positive for a controlled substance then you get fired (sw4048B_0070)
so it you know it's only as catch twenty two (sw4048B_0072)
yeah (sw4048B_0077)
yeah (sw4048B_0078)
it's one of those things that you read wants (sw4048B_0079)
and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it (sw4048B_0080)
yeah (sw4048B_0084)
yeah (sw4048B_0085)
our companies little tougher on second chance (sw4048B_0087)
i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself and then they ought to you know go out of the way i think a little bit more into  the help the kids get you rehabilitated nicotine on to get back at your job (sw4048B_0088)
but  when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply (sw4048B_0090)
well it's it's hard for me to save guy with it because everybody i work around is in an office environment (sw4048B_0092)
you know it's not (sw4048B_0093)
i guess i i haven't run into anybody that that had a problem that's that's been a problem (sw4048B_0094)
 so i get you know i guess at work so much like  well she was like any lottery (sw4048B_0096)
i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked (sw4048B_0097)
so  i'd rather have that then you know say well this week the a's and b's are going to be in (sw4048B_0099)
next week season knees are going to go ahead (sw4048B_0100)
yeah (sw4048B_0102)
right (sw4048B_0103)
right (sw4048B_0104)
yeah (sw4048B_0108)
especially around  you know machinery and stuff (sw4048B_0109)
you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunchtime but not to access any in any case (sw4048B_0111)
 i don't remember to tell you the truth (sw4048B_0115)
i don't think they do (sw4048B_0116)
 why they must (sw4048B_0117)
gee whiz (sw4048B_0118)
i was just so much i haven't paid attention (sw4048B_0119)
cause i i really don't know (sw4048B_0120)
i'll have to go into worked on ask (sw4048B_0121)
but you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far (sw4048B_0123)
there was a company in houston that (sw4048B_0124)
they did  an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company (sw4048B_0125)
 what was it was and it was an an ounce sweep of  (sw4048B_0127)
was not only drugs (sw4048B_0128)
uh-huh (sw4049A_0002)
yeah (sw4049A_0007)
 i guess i basically agree that  (sw4049A_0008)
do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody just knowing that they'll take drugs (sw4049A_0009)
i mean suppose they found out some other way (sw4049A_0010)
yeah (sw4049A_0012)
yeah (sw4049A_0017)
yeah (sw4049A_0020)
have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug testing (sw4049A_0026)
yeah (sw4049A_0027)
yeah (sw4049A_0030)
wants to (sw4049A_0032)
uh-huh (sw4049A_0033)
yeah (sw4049A_0034)
yeah (sw4049A_0039)
they're doing a job interview (sw4049A_0040)
and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them to do this (sw4049A_0041)
and i'm just like well i i'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before we've gotten to know me (sw4049A_0043)
yeah (sw4049A_0062)
like you say i mean if it's not a critical to kind of job where someone could get hurt and really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work and rather than on these other factors (sw4049A_0063)
and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons (sw4049A_0066)
yeah (sw4049A_0068)
well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this (sw4049A_0077)
yeah (sw4049A_0078)
yeah (sw4049A_0080)
i tend to to view it (sw4049A_0086)
even though i don't think i'd worked for a company that did that i sort of want to defend and employers rights as opposed to in in  in addition to an individual's rights (sw4049A_0087)
an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to (sw4049A_0088)
and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that (sw4049A_0090)
 and i don't (sw4049A_0092)
 i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the workplace except in in specific  very specific in this  very specific example such as  transportation workers as in the air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing (sw4049B_0001)
 i don't really think that it's  too many (sw4049B_0003)
severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're a worthy of working for us (sw4049B_0004)
i really don't see that that's a very very valid  thing for a company to say (sw4049B_0005)
and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body (sw4049B_0006)
well i think i think wait i think the problem here is is that a a drug test is not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs are not taking drugs (sw4049B_0011)
there's too many cases where it can you know (sw4049B_0013)
there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing (sw4049B_0014)
i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs (sw4049B_0015)
so we don't want him here (sw4049B_0016)
 like i said some industries though i think it'd be very (sw4049B_0018)
i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying on an airplane (sw4049B_0019)
but  i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal (sw4049B_0021)
i mean if your employer is not going to trust you (sw4049B_0022)
or you know (sw4049B_0023)
i just i think it's a whole trust issue (sw4049B_0024)
i just can't see (sw4049B_0025)
yeah (sw4049B_0028)
right and i mean i was very offended by by the whole process (sw4049B_0031)
i mean it's it's very humiliating (sw4049B_0035)
and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs are against drugs (sw4049B_0036)
but i i am totally against that sort of  (sw4049B_0037)
i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing warn somebody says i want to look at your urine before i mean i talk to you (sw4049B_0038)
right (sw4049B_0042)
yeah (sw4049B_0044)
right (sw4049B_0045)
right (sw4049B_0046)
that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just (sw4049B_0047)
did i was in the same sort of situation is (sw4049B_0048)
it was a job interview (sw4049B_0049)
and then you had a physical where you were drug tested (sw4049B_0050)
and it's (sw4049B_0051)
i just (sw4049B_0052)
i know people who've been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which  you know (sw4049B_0053)
really (sw4049B_0054)
the other side of it is besides that being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluids (sw4049B_0055)
i don't really want you to look at it or something pretty basic like that (sw4049B_0056)
just to the fact that i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work (sw4049B_0058)
i mean during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this these behaviors are acceptable (sw4049B_0059)
these are not (sw4049B_0060)
but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also (sw4049B_0061)
right (sw4049B_0064)
right (sw4049B_0065)
exactly right (sw4049B_0067)
and also i just think it it gets a lot (sw4049B_0069)
i'm a big supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacy (sw4049B_0070)
and i think that it just moved down along the line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees lives outside of work and you know (sw4049B_0071)
there's already talked to people (sw4049B_0072)
well we're not going to hire you if you smoke (sw4049B_0073)
well you know i i can see how they can say in the workplace where you don't want them to smoke (sw4049B_0075)
but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all (sw4049B_0076)
 i really think it should be accepted as i mentioned twice now in these specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear mind it at all times (sw4049B_0079)
and other than that i think i'd do not think it should be allowed (sw4049B_0081)
i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that (sw4049B_0082)
it's kind of the big brother syndrome (sw4049B_0083)
i mean i just (sw4049B_0084)
anything like that just kind of scares me (sw4049B_0085)
right (sw4049B_0089)
right (sw4049B_0091)
hello (sw4050A_0001)
press the button (sw4050A_0002)
so we're recording right now (sw4050A_0003)
i'm sorry (sw4050A_0004)
okay (sw4050A_0007)
and i'm melanie from utah (sw4050A_0008)
yeah (sw4050A_0010)
 no (sw4050A_0011)
we're talking about family reunion (sw4050A_0012)
okay  (sw4050A_0014)
have you ever had to plan a family reunion (sw4050A_0015)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0021)
and how to just fill it went (sw4050A_0022)
all of this planning and in getting together and such (sw4050A_0028)
  let's see what else (sw4050A_0029)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0033)
 boy (sw4050A_0035)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0043)
 my word (sw4050A_0046)
what did you find with most helpful in planning the birthday get together (sw4050A_0047)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0049)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0052)
that's good (sw4050A_0056)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0058)
and then did you have a main male (sw4050A_0059)
or did everyone just bring (sw4050A_0060)
just potluck (sw4050A_0061)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0063)
yeah (sw4050A_0065)
yeah (sw4050A_0066)
show off a little bit (sw4050A_0067)
now how old is she (sw4050A_0072)
 goodness (sw4050A_0074)
is she pretty spry (sw4050A_0075)
she pretty (sw4050A_0076)
 wow (sw4050A_0079)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0081)
 that's neat that she's in good health and that it at that age (sw4050A_0083)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0084)
really (sw4050A_0088)
 that sounds fun (sw4050A_0089)
well i i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago (sw4050A_0090)
and they were (sw4050A_0091)
we send out five hundred  announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there (sw4050A_0092)
and so that was a real challenge (sw4050A_0093)
he was president of our family reunion for two years (sw4050A_0094)
and i wasn't sure i presented that duty for two years in a row (sw4050A_0095)
but i found that advanced planning was the key to success (sw4050A_0096)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0099)
 well it was wonderful though (sw4050A_0102)
  that is that is helpful (sw4050A_0107)
family ranges from  goodness well australia i have a brother lives in australia too  boise idaho and and  all kinds of places (sw4050A_0109)
and (sw4050A_0117)
uh-huh (sw4050A_0122)
boy (sw4050A_0125)
 gosh (sw4050A_0127)
they must really like it there (sw4050A_0129)
yeah (sw4050A_0132)
 you're ready to move on to (sw4050A_0136)
that's okay (sw4050B_0005)
i'm bill from raleigh (sw4050B_0006)
i have another one from a different state besides texas (sw4050B_0009)
right (sw4050B_0013)
 yes (sw4050B_0016)
it wasn't really a a planning one (sw4050B_0017)
but it was kind of  it was a birthday (sw4050B_0018)
and i brought a lot of family together then (sw4050B_0020)
doing pretty good (sw4050B_0023)
 fort in hotels (sw4050B_0024)
so i i kind of know how to do they (sw4050B_0025)
i used to yeah (sw4050B_0027)
usually when we have kind of our family reunion and says my grandmother's birthday (sw4050B_0030)
and and it's olive (sw4050B_0031)
she she comes from a big family (sw4050B_0032)
she has like seven sisters i think (sw4050B_0034)
they show up now there are kids (sw4050B_0036)
and then (sw4050B_0037)
she has  (sw4050B_0038)
i have like  (sw4050B_0039)
she has four sons and two daughters (sw4050B_0041)
and they show up and all their kids (sw4050B_0042)
so it's a pretty big reunion (sw4050B_0044)
about two hundred people maybe (sw4050B_0045)
 the probably the biggest challenge was was getting a place where everyone you know i could eat comfortably and and everything  (sw4050B_0048)
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that  for the rent we rented like a rescue squad building or something like that (sw4050B_0050)
and  each one of the everybody that showed up detonated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks (sw4050B_0053)
and so nobody really got stuck with the veil (sw4050B_0054)
each person in the family you know brother dish (sw4050B_0057)
it was kind of pot luck (sw4050B_0062)
you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say (sw4050B_0064)
and of course my grandmother's food was it was always gone first 'cause she's such a great (sw4050B_0069)
 she's eighty six (sw4050B_0073)
and she (sw4050B_0077)
she lives probably like she's in her early sixties (sw4050B_0078)
and she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better yes matter of fact (sw4050B_0080)
 yeah (sw4050B_0085)
my nickname pores hunting woman (sw4050B_0086)
that's what i call (sw4050B_0087)
and i'll say one thing that's helpful (sw4050B_0097)
i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever (sw4050B_0098)
but most of my all my family live like in the same count (sw4050B_0100)
but (sw4050B_0101)
it's just kinda like get on the telephone (sw4050B_0103)
it's so it's such such and such day (sw4050B_0104)
everybody just shows up (sw4050B_0106)
i would say you're spread out there (sw4050B_0110)
that was my my immediate family my my parents and my brothers and stuff i guess for the ones that has a gypsy blood or whatever (sw4050B_0112)
because my dad was in the army (sw4050B_0113)
and we were pretty strong out all over (sw4050B_0114)
but since i moved back to carolina's  we still are the only ones do not live and and the aunts and county (sw4050B_0116)
i live in raleigh (sw4050B_0119)
my my parents live in greenville (sw4050B_0120)
i have one brother and his wife lives in greenville and  another brother that lives outside of fat (sw4050B_0121)
so i mean we're we're spread out (sw4050B_0123)
but everybody else's centralized and in my home town weights (sw4050B_0124)
nobody moves away (sw4050B_0128)
yeah (sw4050B_0130)
i got out as soon as i graduated (sw4050B_0131)
and it's like this town is too small for me (sw4050B_0134)
get by (sw4050B_0135)
okay (sw4051A_0001)
you want to start (sw4051A_0002)
yeah (sw4051A_0009)
that stuff we never even thought about four years ago (sw4051A_0010)
they stopped that practice now (sw4051A_0020)
yeah (sw4051A_0024)
yeah (sw4051A_0029)
yeah (sw4051A_0036)
 yeah (sw4051A_0045)
i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or best for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark smoke (sw4051A_0047)
and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars (sw4051A_0049)
but that that particular bothers me (sw4051A_0051)
uh-huh (sw4051A_0053)
yeah (sw4051A_0059)
 i see (sw4051A_0065)
yeah (sw4051B_0003)
might as well (sw4051B_0004)
 one of the things i'm very concerned about air pollution is the  this is the ozone layer    issue (sw4051B_0005)
 i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of free different types of friends (sw4051B_0006)
and that  rather bothers me that  i was in in effect  contributing to the delinquent sea of the the environment so to speak (sw4051B_0007)
right (sw4051B_0011)
right (sw4051B_0012)
and one of the reasons i fixed up the eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive (sw4051B_0013)
 they can be made  you know which inexpensive and lots of it  (sw4051B_0014)
and then that's (sw4051B_0015)
and it's properties were great  with  the machinery (sw4051B_0016)
didn't have to have lots of an expensive machinery to  get your heating and cooling cycles to work (sw4051B_0017)
yeah (sw4051B_0019)
well of course there's only a a tremendous number of  refrigerators and free or excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential  utilizing twelve (sw4051B_0021)
and of course the the new cars i guess starting one night nineteen ninety three well not have free on twelve and their systems (sw4051B_0022)
but  there's you know there's a ton of after market machines and cetera et cetera (sw4051B_0023)
and that's gotten me very can you know highly concerned that  it's going to be quite a while before we can  and do this (sw4051B_0025)
now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession (sw4051B_0026)
but you get out and have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion (sw4051B_0027)
so  so i see us in the somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to  have us  as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all his free on twelve stuff into the the new non polluting   compound (sw4051B_0028)
because as i say there's a there's a term men (sw4051B_0030)
well how many   families owned the refrigerator (sw4051B_0031)
and then you know that number (sw4051B_0032)
and then how many on   a freezer separate from (sw4051B_0033)
and how many people especially here in texas owned cars and trucks with air conditioning (sw4051B_0034)
i mean this is there there are people that make it have a thriving business  do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks (sw4051B_0038)
and  the only reason i didn't get into that more when i was at my little businesses because  most of your  air conditioning in vehicles tend to be breezy and dirty to the nth degree (sw4051B_0039)
and i mean (sw4051B_0041)
so  that's why i stayed in state and more towards   (sw4051B_0042)
and that's a polluted polluting type deal too is  excessive  you know  petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth (sw4051B_0043)
in the dirt and britain than those two mixed together with with water and that really make a make a mess (sw4051B_0044)
right (sw4051B_0050)
well most most of the time when you see bus  you know the buses with the diesel that's  those are carbon particles and carbon dioxide and water vapor  (sw4051B_0052)
because when you when diesel is burned it's (sw4051B_0054)
you know diesel fuel was burned in a in in in the diesel engine (sw4051B_0055)
burned so completely but you don't have any   nitric oxide  or rock sides of nitrogen  to a forum because  by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine 'cause diesel oil is  is not very volatile you know or gasoline if you leave a little pilot gasoline out before long it's gone (sw4051B_0056)
these old is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily (sw4051B_0060)
and it's got (sw4051B_0061)
 you know it's it's late and heat is high (sw4051B_0062)
but it's slow burning it at a normal pressures (sw4051B_0063)
that's why your have such high compression ratios is is areas heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one of the nineteen or nineteen to one ratio (sw4051B_0064)
and so if the  fifty degrees (sw4051B_0068)
okay (sw4055A_0001)
right (sw4055A_0002)
okay (sw4055A_0004)
have you done much camping (sw4055A_0005)
 well that sounds good (sw4055A_0011)
yeah (sw4055A_0013)
yeah (sw4055A_0014)
 now do you have a lot of (sw4055A_0015)
well you don't have mountains in texas too (sw4055A_0016)
where do you find places to camp (sw4055A_0017)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0021)
 my word (sw4055A_0024)
that sounds adventuresome (sw4055A_0025)
well  i've done  i would say quite a bit of campaign mostly with my husband and i (sw4055A_0027)
 we have five children (sw4055A_0028)
and so we have found that to camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable is just when we go ourselves (sw4055A_0029)
so we've tried to get out once a year and go on the anniversary camp out (sw4055A_0030)
and we have gone up into the mountains and  not necessarily rushed it (sw4055A_0031)
that we have just found it does real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains (sw4055A_0032)
and then the boys are our boys are old enough now (sw4055A_0034)
twelve and eleven (sw4055A_0035)
so they're involved in the scouting (sw4055A_0036)
they do a lot of camping with the scouts (sw4055A_0037)
and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week (sw4055A_0039)
so this year no both be going (sw4055A_0040)
and so that's been real enjoyable for them (sw4055A_0041)
 yes (sw4055A_0047)
they well (sw4055A_0048)
no (sw4055A_0049)
actually they've i remember they have taken the the the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and and the cooking there over the fire (sw4055A_0050)
and i don't think they've taken the stove (sw4055A_0051)
 last year they camped intense (sw4055A_0052)
and this year i believe it will be intense also (sw4055A_0053)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0056)
yeah (sw4055A_0057)
 is that right (sw4055A_0060)
 and what does that consist (sw4055A_0062)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0065)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0071)
yeah (sw4055A_0075)
let's see when we when we go camping here (sw4055A_0076)
we have to take her big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of dance (sw4055A_0077)
and i like to sleep on the air mattresses (sw4055A_0078)
i'm not (sw4055A_0079)
my bones are getting so (sw4055A_0080)
i like to i like to sleep on the mattress (sw4055A_0081)
 so have you had any adventure near camping trips with encounters that's wild animals or anything like that (sw4055A_0083)
anywhere (sw4055A_0089)
jeeze (sw4055A_0090)
 they're covered with like a heavy armor type stuff (sw4055A_0104)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0105)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0110)
but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything (sw4055A_0112)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0116)
uh-huh (sw4055A_0117)
 my word (sw4055A_0119)
well that sounds a little less fierce and bears (sw4055A_0121)
we've we want (sw4055A_0122)
yes (sw4055B_0003)
 yes (sw4055B_0006)
i'm a scout master and boy scouts (sw4055B_0007)
i can't but every month  camp at least one weekend (sw4055B_0009)
during the summer we can't buy two or three weeks here (sw4055B_0010)
i'd say i can't quite a bit (sw4055B_0012)
well  we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping (sw4055B_0018)
and we  we also  carry all our equipment with us (sw4055B_0020)
and so we can go down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the  san bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again (sw4055B_0022)
how 'bout yourself (sw4055B_0026)
so that's good (sw4055B_0033)
great (sw4055B_0042)
what  what kind of camping you they're like best (sw4055B_0044)
do they like it where they have tents (sw4055B_0045)
and  do they (sw4055B_0046)
i imagine it gets cold and parts of utah (sw4055B_0055)
it doesn't get very cold in texas (sw4055B_0058)
so lots of times we don't even take tense (sw4055B_0059)
we just used (sw4055B_0061)
 it's just a piece of material that has  that has a lot of  places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent  like a (sw4055B_0063)
they're very light weights (sw4055B_0066)
we use them when we go backpacking (sw4055B_0067)
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles (sw4055B_0068)
then (sw4055B_0069)
they're not very heavy (sw4055B_0070)
so you can carry on with you (sw4055B_0072)
they'll keep your dry or whatever (sw4055B_0073)
yes (sw4055B_0084)
in fact   last month we went camping (sw4055B_0085)
we saw a lot of deer  in the morning and in the afternoon (sw4055B_0086)
just deer everywhere (sw4055B_0087)
so  but it even though it wasn't a hunting season (sw4055B_0092)
and we were with boy scouts (sw4055B_0093)
so of course we don't want to go hunting (sw4055B_0094)
but we got to see a lot of deer  out and about (sw4055B_0096)
and there's (sw4055B_0098)
of course we see smaller animals all the time (sw4055B_0099)
 one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night  is  make sure the all the foods put away and so forth because  we have  armadillos (sw4055B_0100)
do you know the armadillo this (sw4055B_0102)
and possums and  raccoons (sw4055B_0107)
and  we have those  creatures down here that they like to  they like to go hunting for  a midnight snack (sw4055B_0109)
and so that that that that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away (sw4055B_0111)
they will if you attack them (sw4055B_0113)
but most time they run away from you if you if they if they see you're up you know (sw4055B_0115)
but they don't have any problem walking right by if you're asleep (sw4055B_0118)
uh-huh (sw4055B_0120)
okay (sw4056A_0001)
should be (sw4056A_0002)
 i can begin this  (sw4056A_0005)
but i work for honeywell in minneapolis (sw4056A_0006)
and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good (sw4056A_0008)
i'm pretty pleased with it (sw4056A_0009)
cover  just about everything vision dental medical (sw4056A_0010)
 you name it (sw4056A_0012)
and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much (sw4056A_0013)
i'm pretty satisfied myself (sw4056A_0014)
what's your situation (sw4056A_0016)
professor there (sw4056A_0025)
 i see (sw4056A_0029)
okay (sw4056A_0030)
no doubt (sw4056A_0032)
right (sw4056A_0035)
 that's good (sw4056A_0036)
that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell yeah (sw4056A_0039)
i used to work with the army research institute (sw4056A_0040)
being a government organization you got quite a few holidays off (sw4056A_0041)
here you don't get that (sw4056A_0043)
maybe get two or three years (sw4056A_0044)
so it's really (sw4056A_0046)
shoo unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever  you kinda have to finagle your way around to get that time (sw4056A_0047)
so that's kind of a drawback i think (sw4056A_0049)
but  i don't know (sw4056A_0050)
what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits (sw4056A_0051)
yeah (sw4056A_0055)
i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night they  they basically reviewed oregon's plan for the oregon plan toward  nationalizing healthcare and that kind of thing (sw4056A_0061)
kind of an interesting place (sw4056A_0064)
it's kinda cold though (sw4056A_0065)
they've essentially made up a list of   all the different  medical nowadays that you can have and they basically made a cut off (sw4056A_0066)
about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by  subsidized healthcare (sw4056A_0068)
and the ones above what (sw4056A_0069)
so it's kinda like drawn this line (sw4056A_0071)
and if you have it (sw4056A_0072)
you don't you're kinda outta luck (sw4056A_0073)
 it was it was an interesting show (sw4056A_0075)
i think you're right (sw4056A_0077)
i think healthcare is probably the most depressing  depressing (sw4056A_0078)
but i'll tell you i i don't mind having dental you know (sw4056A_0080)
sometimes dental costs can be  just about as expensive if not more (sw4056A_0081)
and i know historically a lot of companies i think harry dental as a writer along with the medical (sw4056A_0082)
but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed anymore (sw4056A_0084)
i'm not sure (sw4056A_0085)
how does  university of new hampshire (sw4056A_0086)
yeah (sw4056A_0093)
is that  we interrupted at the same for both  professors and and also staffing administration (sw4056A_0095)
that generally across the board you think (sw4056A_0096)
right (sw4056A_0101)
 okay (sw4056A_0107)
yeah (sw4056A_0109)
i'm kinda interested 'cause i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take one i finally get my degree is too i used to teach in university (sw4056A_0112)
a doctoral student in florida right now (sw4056A_0115)
hum (sw4056A_0117)
yeah (sw4056A_0118)
that's that's interesting (sw4056A_0119)
it's one of the things i like to think about is and what kind of benefits i would  that would cover and things like that (sw4056A_0120)
is that right (sw4056A_0122)
okay (sw4056B_0003)
alright (sw4056B_0004)
uh-huh (sw4056B_0007)
uh-huh (sw4056B_0011)
uh-huh (sw4056B_0015)
i work for the university of new hampshire (sw4056B_0017)
and  our benefits package isn't  isn't quite as good in in some ways  (sw4056B_0018)
overall i'm satisfied with it (sw4056B_0020)
we don't have the vision (sw4056B_0021)
who have the health care and the  in the medical  the dental (sw4056B_0022)
nope (sw4056B_0026)
i work in i'm in  on the professional administrative and technical stats (sw4056B_0027)
i  effectively i run the telephone switch it  at the university of new hampshire (sw4056B_0028)
 so the  the the benefits probably the main thing i like about the benefits as the  the  very generous vacation time and (sw4056B_0031)
get we get we get fifteen days a year sick time (sw4056B_0033)
and  we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start working get twenty four days a year  time off (sw4056B_0034)
yeah (sw4056B_0037)
right (sw4056B_0042)
uh-huh (sw4056B_0045)
i think  the the healthcare courses isn't important in has to be the single most important benefit (sw4056B_0052)
and  the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing  you know (sw4056B_0054)
i'm a little disturbed about that (sw4056B_0056)
but i think that's a national trend (sw4056B_0057)
i don't know that  i don't know what the solution is to it (sw4056B_0058)
bigger than just the benefits (sw4056B_0059)
hum (sw4056B_0062)
right (sw4056B_0063)
yeah (sw4056B_0067)
well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to hundred dental  depending (sw4056B_0087)
and then the cost between them is very is very little (sw4056B_0088)
i think it cost me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan (sw4056B_0089)
but it pays a substantial amount (sw4056B_0091)
the examinations and and  checkups every year or every six months of free (sw4056B_0092)
and  it it covers the bulk of the damn expensive (sw4056B_0094)
 yes (sw4056B_0098)
yeah (sw4056B_0099)
the benefits plan is different for operate for cooperating staff which are considered to be  clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the which i belong to (sw4056B_0100)
but the main (sw4056B_0103)
i think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and their retirement plan (sw4056B_0104)
but the main differences in the  the way sick time as a crude and and vacation time as a crew (sw4056B_0105)
 for the operating staff it's on a senior already it's  you know based on how long they've worked there (sw4056B_0108)
that determines how much a vacation time again (sw4056B_0110)
college programs  belong to this t i a c r e f a retirement fund (sw4056B_0121)
right (sw4056B_0123)
and in the case the university of new hampshire (sw4056B_0124)
okay (sw4060A_0001)
your your first (sw4060A_0002)
okay (sw4060A_0007)
yeah (sw4060A_0009)
i guess one of the differences i see is  working for a university  there is room for advancement but not so much so  or you know quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an administrative association (sw4060A_0010)
so there is a progressive path (sw4060A_0012)
but not being in the say the commercials sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people  like really (sw4060A_0013)
yeah (sw4060A_0017)
somewhat that (sw4060A_0018)
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have  a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances (sw4060A_0019)
 so that's in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution (sw4060A_0021)
 it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual performance (sw4060A_0022)
and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a large  institution and perhaps somewhat even with a business  (sw4060A_0024)
but i agree you know the  medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses for working for a large organization and also the  security aspect for a long term employment  (sw4060A_0025)
job security (sw4060A_0030)
yes (sw4060A_0031)
yeah (sw4060A_0038)
we're seeing that here as well (sw4060A_0039)
in some of the large oil companies there's been massive layoffs (sw4060A_0040)
 so i i think there is probably  major distinction between institutions and the corporate world and  institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do (sw4060A_0042)
but (sw4060A_0046)
yeah (sw4060A_0048)
institutionally like here at the university  if there's a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily is needed (sw4060A_0049)
where it's most expedient which (sw4060A_0050)
well in one sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type rolls (sw4060A_0051)
so (sw4060A_0060)
it's very easy (sw4060A_0064)
yeah (sw4060A_0067)
right (sw4060A_0070)
because it's a support people that are providing the speed for it (sw4060A_0071)
well the  (sw4060A_0077)
that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess (sw4060A_0078)
because my perspective is from an institution (sw4060A_0080)
 the there is not much incentive for you know because the the limitation for reward is is very severe (sw4060A_0081)
but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for i guess (sw4060A_0084)
although he's the you know the more complex restructure the  last difficult it is to kind of carry some things through (sw4060A_0085)
but  i think there is  it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's  things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts (sw4060A_0087)
right (sw4060A_0092)
yeah (sw4060A_0095)
you end up being your own person (sw4060A_0096)
and  if you do your job fine and if somebody else's messing it up well then that's their problem (sw4060A_0098)
and you know you really (sw4060A_0099)
yeah (sw4060A_0103)
yeah (sw4060A_0104)
it becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves (sw4060A_0105)
okay (sw4060B_0003)
just going to say i think one of the biggest thing is for me is like the room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job (sw4060B_0004)
and plus for me it's i mean like medical you know  benefits and dental (sw4060B_0006)
and also important (sw4060B_0008)
are they like pretty much trained for a specific job (sw4060B_0015)
that's what they're hired for and then i just very little variation from there (sw4060B_0016)
well that's kind of interesting (sw4060B_0026)
because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore (sw4060B_0027)
i used to think that you know after you were (sw4060B_0028)
you mean security job security (sw4060B_0029)
 that used to be i think a couple of years ago (sw4060B_0032)
i don't know if it is so much anymore (sw4060B_0033)
in fact they we just had to lay off and what november i guess (sw4060B_0034)
but  it wasn't necessarily (sw4060B_0036)
you know some people had been there a long time (sw4060B_0037)
no doubt (sw4060B_0045)
yeah (sw4060B_0047)
experience (sw4060B_0052)
exactly (sw4060B_0054)
yeah (sw4060B_0055)
we're the most  or what it where it and you know (sw4060B_0056)
yeah (sw4060B_0059)
yeah (sw4060B_0061)
i think that's one of the things too yeah (sw4060B_0062)
you get too many management people you know (sw4060B_0063)
yeah (sw4060B_0065)
it's very easy for them to say  this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know (sw4060B_0066)
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time (sw4060B_0068)
those people aren't there anymore (sw4060B_0069)
yeah (sw4060B_0072)
yeah (sw4060B_0074)
but (sw4060B_0075)
so what else do you think is important (sw4060B_0076)
i think probably in a smaller (sw4060B_0088)
yeah (sw4060B_0089)
i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing (sw4060B_0090)
you probably have a better team  cooperation our team playing atmosphere (sw4060B_0091)
probably (sw4060B_0093)
whereas in the bigger corporations sometimes you think you're just a number you know (sw4060B_0094)
yeah in a smaller (sw4060B_0101)
i think you'd be more willing to help that person or help but get accomplished (sw4060B_0102)
how do you feel about trial by jury (sw4064A_0001)
in what way (sw4064A_0004)
i mean do you feel that they're swayed more (sw4064A_0007)
about what criminal or civil suit (sw4064A_0008)
so you think that i mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart curious where they feel sorry (sw4064A_0010)
and the other thing and then it really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be (sw4064A_0016)
i like the idea of jury of your peers  in that you you you get more of the first of all you get more than one person making the decision making a decision (sw4064A_0017)
and second of all you get a wide variety of background so (sw4064A_0019)
agreed (sw4064A_0023)
so that's definitely a problem (sw4064A_0025)
yeah (sw4064A_0038)
i i guess i i definitely agree with you (sw4064A_0040)
but (sw4064A_0041)
well and i don't like about  the juries doing the sentencing and that i think it becomes a lot less (sw4064A_0042)
the same crime yes unequal sentences (sw4064A_0044)
i i think there's more of an ability of you know you know you for selecting a jury duty different juries that would most of the time for the same idea eating the same idea of versus you know whether he's guilty or innocent (sw4064A_0046)
i think i think that there's that there'd be a large variation in in trying to gauge the severity of the crime and inappropriate punishment and and have that that measure stick across the board (sw4064A_0049)
of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to  get a good lawyer (sw4064A_0059)
yeah (sw4064A_0068)
i agree (sw4064A_0069)
 yeah (sw4064A_0073)
i i agree (sw4064A_0074)
yeah (sw4064A_0075)
you know admit to you that they can they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client innocent or guilty (sw4064A_0076)
it's more of the game plan of how do they convinced the judge or jury through argument (sw4064A_0078)
that's it (sw4064A_0080)
yeah (sw4064A_0089)
 and it's a little bit off the subject (sw4064A_0090)
but one one thing that i that i really dislike  also there that's new is the  is i've i've heard that  there are federal sense (sw4064A_0091)
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently (sw4064B_0002)
and that it seems to me they're swayed more by motion than  by evidence presented (sw4064B_0005)
i have  very little regard for the law presently practice (sw4064B_0006)
i was thinking primarily criminal cases (sw4064B_0009)
yes (sw4064B_0011)
that's a concern of mine (sw4064B_0013)
 i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges  you know doing the sentence (sw4064B_0014)
yeah (sw4064B_0020)
my question i guess is are they really your peers (sw4064B_0021)
  too often i think they're not (sw4064B_0024)
and  when you when you were selecting a jury and you're doing it partially it if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have you know that's a matter of concern to me too (sw4064B_0027)
 i think that  in such cases  they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased (sw4064B_0029)
 no i happen to know several judges (sw4064B_0031)
and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but have men doing sentencing without the (sw4064B_0032)
i feel a little bit uneasy about (sw4064B_0033)
but the other two i feel  would give either you know the the plane before the defendant of the the full benefit of the law (sw4064B_0035)
and i guess that's what i'm concerned (sw4064B_0037)
this is very true (sw4064B_0045)
yeah (sw4064B_0050)
you do see such  uneven sentencing  you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean where  it would appear that the crimes we're very similar (sw4064B_0051)
but one individual got twenty five years (sw4064B_0054)
and the other one was sentenced to life (sw4064B_0055)
isn't that the truth (sw4064B_0060)
at times when (sw4064B_0062)
is it  (sw4064B_0063)
 goodness my mind going blind (sw4064B_0064)
  fat (sw4064B_0065)
you know where he says kill all the lawyers (sw4064B_0066)
every now and then was tempted to feel that way (sw4064B_0067)
but  it's taken me a long time to understand that  lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of you know as novices tend to think that the attorneys care about justice (sw4064B_0070)
and they're very effective too (sw4064B_0079)
 even (sw4064B_0082)
i've been involved in it just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty (sw4064B_0083)
but  his attorney's gotten him off (sw4064B_0085)
 city has dropped their charges against him because they're the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge (sw4064B_0087)
so i don't know (sw4064B_0088)
jackie  on taxes i i guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is i i do think that americans are paying too much in taxes (sw4071A_0001)
what's your feeling about that (sw4071A_0002)
right (sw4071A_0005)
 where you live do you have a state income tax on the sales tax both (sw4071A_0006)
uh-huh uh-huh (sw4071A_0009)
in new hampshire we have   no no what we call broadbased taxes (sw4071A_0010)
no income tax and no sales tax (sw4071A_0011)
 we tax business  eight percent (sw4071A_0013)
businesses attacks eight percent (sw4071A_0014)
and we have  what we call the five bees  for our taxes booze  bought cigarettes beds  a hotel room tax belize a meal tax and bats  gambling (sw4071A_0015)
so  we do have a very low tax rates (sw4071A_0018)
but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that americans are generally do paint too too much in taxes (sw4071A_0019)
yeah (sw4071A_0028)
that's nice (sw4071A_0031)
nice to nice to get a refund (sw4071A_0034)
uh-huh (sw4071A_0039)
do you think that  for whatever taxes we do pay that we're getting value for (sw4071A_0040)
yeah (sw4071A_0042)
my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to washington or to the state and they say they're going to send them back (sw4071A_0043)
it's like giving yourself it's like one arm given the other a transfusion (sw4071A_0044)
you know what i mean (sw4071A_0046)
 it really (sw4071A_0048)
i should say one i'm giving another  a transfusion through a leaky too because (sw4071A_0049)
right (sw4071A_0050)
because  there's an old saying amongst taxes and politicians that  there's a fly paper effect (sw4071A_0051)
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first (sw4071A_0054)
and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capital  a lot of it stays there (sw4071A_0055)
and  not that much comes back to you (sw4071A_0056)
that's (sw4071A_0072)
well it does it get it does seem that  the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend (sw4071A_0076)
 it's almost like they'll spend as much as the there were they are allowed to collect (sw4071A_0077)
 i there's an interesting proposal it's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax  ten percent or thirteen percent (sw4071A_0079)
it'd be know figuring (sw4071A_0080)
you would take your income tax (sw4071A_0081)
you'd have a certain amount (sw4071A_0082)
i mean you you take your total salary (sw4071A_0083)
those who made under a certain amount of wouldn't  any taxes (sw4071A_0085)
and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependence you had (sw4071A_0086)
and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you you know after you figure out who's in your family (sw4071A_0087)
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s (sw4071A_0090)
and it would eliminate all these loopholes at the fat cats get away with (sw4071A_0091)
yeah (sw4071A_0094)
i'd like to see something like that (sw4071A_0096)
i think it would be fair (sw4071A_0097)
and  it would put you know a lot of a tax attorney is out of business (sw4071A_0098)
and i'm sure they'll fight a tooth and nail (sw4071A_0099)
but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fair for all americans (sw4071A_0100)
i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes well somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes (sw4071A_0103)
and seem fair to me (sw4071A_0106)
right (sw4071A_0111)
i think your taxes in wisconsin are pretty high or if i'm not mistaken i think (sw4071A_0114)
i mean for your state (sw4071A_0115)
what is you know what your state income tax rate is (sw4071A_0117)
twenty percent (sw4071A_0119)
just you just pay it  (sw4071A_0123)
yeah like my daughter was in in college down in massachusetts (sw4071A_0125)
and  she works as a waitress (sw4071A_0126)
and she's attending college full time also (sw4071A_0127)
she sends their taxes to me (sw4071A_0129)
and i figure them out (sw4071A_0130)
she really has no idea (sw4071A_0131)
she gets a refund checked (sw4071A_0132)
and (sw4071A_0133)
i agree (sw4071B_0003)
i think taxes are high (sw4071B_0004)
 yes (sw4071B_0007)
uh-huh (sw4071B_0008)
right (sw4071B_0021)
yeah (sw4071B_0022)
i agree (sw4071B_0023)
it this time of year where they usually start getting (sw4071B_0024)
if you do get money back from like jobs (sw4071B_0025)
i'm still a student (sw4071B_0026)
so  i only work part time (sw4071B_0027)
i i get a check back (sw4071B_0029)
from from texas (sw4071B_0032)
yeah (sw4071B_0035)
right it's not much (sw4071B_0037)
no (sw4071B_0041)
yeah (sw4071B_0045)
yeah (sw4071B_0047)
there you go (sw4071B_0053)
right (sw4071B_0057)
yeah (sw4071B_0058)
yeah (sw4071B_0059)
doesn't seem like they're doing much with it (sw4071B_0061)
i mean there's plans (sw4071B_0062)
now with the voting and and people you know getting in the senate and government and stuff (sw4071B_0063)
they have nice plan (sw4071B_0065)
 but they always worked (sw4071B_0066)
and then you know they try to raise taxes (sw4071B_0067)
and i don't know what happened was that money because if their plans don't work you know (sw4071B_0068)
the taxes get raised (sw4071B_0069)
i don't know (sw4071B_0070)
i met you know really into politics (sw4071B_0071)
really understand it (sw4071B_0073)
but it's just you know (sw4071B_0075)
right (sw4071B_0078)
right (sw4071B_0088)
yeah (sw4071B_0092)
there could be nice (sw4071B_0093)
right (sw4071B_0101)
yeah (sw4071B_0102)
right (sw4071B_0104)
yeah (sw4071B_0107)
there's not much out there that's fair (sw4071B_0109)
for sure (sw4071B_0110)
agree to that (sw4071B_0113)
 no (sw4071B_0118)
i i have no idea (sw4071B_0120)
my dad does (sw4071B_0122)
yeah (sw4071B_0124)
okay (sw4072A_0001)
how do you keep up with current events (sw4072A_0002)
yeah (sw4072A_0005)
what channel do you watch what station (sw4072A_0006)
that's the one i watched (sw4072A_0008)
i usually keep up with t v (sw4072A_0009)
i'm a student (sw4072A_0011)
so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff (sw4072A_0012)
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great soon (sw4072A_0014)
yeah (sw4072A_0019)
the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes (sw4072A_0020)
the stations i listen to everyone just mainly music (sw4072A_0021)
yeah (sw4072A_0024)
do you think that t v is  pretty accurate (sw4072A_0025)
i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized (sw4072A_0026)
yeah (sw4072A_0027)
yeah (sw4072A_0030)
yeah (sw4072A_0031)
it's (sw4072A_0032)
they mainly and like popular topics just not like basically (sw4072A_0033)
yeah (sw4072A_0038)
going (sw4072A_0040)
well it's like they're going more for ratings and for you know actual on these (sw4072A_0041)
i think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspaper (sw4072A_0043)
they typically has (sw4072A_0045)
i'm from a small town too here in texas (sw4072A_0046)
instead of it like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato (sw4072A_0047)
yeah (sw4072A_0052)
farm report in oil reports (sw4072A_0053)
pretty it's pretty sad (sw4072A_0054)
who killed who (sw4072A_0055)
yeah (sw4072A_0060)
well i'm in dallas  i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into movies (sw4072A_0061)
story was  (sw4072A_0062)
yeah (sw4072A_0064)
and the news covered it like you know hours after it happened (sw4072A_0065)
they were typing people who are crying he had everything (sw4072A_0067)
and then like three days later this local news station was using as it is there a promo to promote themselves (sw4072A_0069)
i just thought that was really kind of cold (sw4072A_0071)
yeah (sw4072A_0077)
and it was just (sw4072A_0078)
they were selling like these dead people (sw4072A_0079)
and they were showing people crying (sw4072A_0081)
just taken advantage of you know (sw4072A_0083)
yeah (sw4072A_0085)
yeah (sw4072A_0087)
it didn't seem like there was like much coverage as a story that just to play on people's emotions (sw4072A_0088)
it's just gotten so (sw4072A_0089)
i mean somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they used to have like an walter cronkite days you know (sw4072A_0090)
and everything (sw4072A_0092)
yeah (sw4072A_0096)
yeah (sw4072A_0098)
what did you think of the coverage of the war (sw4072A_0100)
to do (sw4072A_0102)
yeah (sw4072A_0104)
they kept showing you know how great we're we're doing (sw4072A_0107)
i never really showed what actually the damage that really happens (sw4072A_0108)
a lotta times like the news coverage showed all the you know guys who didn't get hurt coming home and now the big parties (sw4072A_0111)
and they kind of you know (sw4072A_0113)
if they were going to show that let him they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything (sw4072A_0114)
 well actually usually  in the morning it's i'm getting ready to eat it to go to work  (sw4072B_0003)
usually catch the news in the morning (sw4072B_0004)
n b c (sw4072B_0007)
yeah (sw4072B_0015)
basically tend to just you know rely on you know t v  through the grapevine just just to know like yeah what what the date stories (sw4072B_0017)
i usually go out and buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one (sw4072B_0018)
you pretty much have to listen to like an all news station to get any news at all (sw4072B_0023)
i really don't like about t v and especially local news is compared to like national news is just  it seems it seems like everything is very spoon fed (sw4072B_0028)
and you know it's it's more like the news shows now and and it is now you know an entertainment chilling a sitcom or like a new so you know because i always have you know the the wonderful investigative report you know is is your kids bus driver smoking crack on the way the school you know (sw4072B_0029)
yeah (sw4072B_0035)
you also have had the observation with  the press is that like any any story that i had any first hand knowledge of that i've seen the press you know we're just probably happen like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually in their head and had more than just a blurb about it that that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story (sw4072B_0036)
something wrong (sw4072B_0039)
farm report (sw4072B_0051)
 found that like in newspapers probably aren't as bad as television (sw4072B_0057)
britain story and just found it so incredibly watered down (sw4072B_0058)
well like he like searching people's cafeteria or something (sw4072B_0063)
i've seen that having lots of times (sw4072B_0073)
channel acts gives you the covered (sw4072B_0074)
we were on the scene with our team players (sw4072B_0075)
just trying to get the you know the most emotional response for (sw4072B_0086)
yeah (sw4072B_0091)
yeah (sw4072B_0093)
you know pretty much stopped watching local news totally (sw4072B_0095)
 you know and even the national news i just find it to be very watered down (sw4072B_0097)
very (sw4072B_0099)
 yeah i found it very one sided (sw4072B_0101)
 yeah i mean it just it just seemed a lack of any sort of debate (sw4072B_0103)
 yeah you know i'm not saying that we should we we we definitely should have been there we shouldn't have been there (sw4072B_0105)
but it just seemed like (sw4072B_0106)
yeah (sw4072B_0116)
i really think that you know in in the involvement that the press basis you know the the the military basically said the press (sw4072B_0117)
dave (sw4074A_0001)
kind of pets do you have (sw4074A_0002)
one rotten cat (sw4074A_0004)
i heard of life in the background (sw4074A_0007)
 you like cats (sw4074A_0011)
 yeah (sw4074A_0014)
that's it (sw4074A_0019)
how do you treat the other people (sw4074A_0020)
wow (sw4074A_0022)
you raise them or something (sw4074A_0027)
uh-huh (sw4074A_0033)
 that's interesting (sw4074A_0034)
we have  a mutt (sw4074A_0036)
well we we named it who perfect 'cause that's where we got it from (sw4074A_0038)
 some lady she  (sw4074A_0040)
a lot of people  drop off the bat and abandoned pets at our house (sw4074A_0041)
and she used to work for veterinarian (sw4074A_0043)
so she would stay  neuter 'em give 'em all their shots (sw4074A_0044)
and we saw an ad saying it was free (sw4074A_0046)
so we went down there and pick it up (sw4074A_0047)
and it's been an excellent dog (sw4074A_0048)
that is my first dog i've had (sw4074A_0049)
and we got up because my wife stays here at home a long while i go to work (sw4074A_0050)
so that's mostly why we got to keep her company  a way to work (sw4074A_0052)
 yeah (sw4074A_0054)
right now is it is (sw4074A_0055)
it's kind of a good training (sw4074A_0057)
i mean we've been trying for kids (sw4074A_0058)
and now we haven't had any (sw4074A_0059)
but it's pretty good training i think i mean he keeps us on our toes (sw4074A_0061)
 my brother has (sw4074A_0063)
 we didn't do a lot with them (sw4074A_0064)
 i never felt like it was mine or anything (sw4074A_0065)
because i didn't do anything (sw4074A_0066)
but i mean it's a bit more responsibility when it's yours and not your brother (sw4074A_0068)
but (sw4074A_0070)
so we found (sw4074A_0077)
that like a cockatoo (sw4074A_0078)
big it's half cocker spaniel poodle (sw4074A_0080)
but it's a really good dog (sw4074A_0082)
and (sw4074A_0084)
they seem to be i mean listen better or something (sw4074A_0085)
is your cat a purebred (sw4074A_0087)
uh-huh (sw4074A_0093)
would you ever want a dog and the family (sw4074A_0095)
 yeah (sw4074A_0101)
 yeah (sw4074A_0113)
wow (sw4074A_0133)
they just need a lot of time (sw4074A_0136)
 we have one rotten cat (sw4074B_0003)
yeah (sw4074B_0005)
my son's cat (sw4074B_0006)
yeah (sw4074B_0008)
that's the boys (sw4074B_0009)
they know i don't like it (sw4074B_0010)
well i like cats (sw4074B_0012)
this cat is a  more like a dog (sw4074B_0013)
yeah (sw4074B_0015)
he's  a one on her (sw4074B_0016)
he likes one boy and the family (sw4074B_0017)
and that's about it (sw4074B_0018)
just  stays away or runs easily (sw4074B_0021)
but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around (sw4074B_0023)
you know when he's in the house he'll come up (sw4074B_0024)
you know jump on his lap (sw4074B_0025)
there if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever kind of look at him like what are you doing (sw4074B_0026)
and he's it we bought the cat for him (sw4074B_0028)
so he's he's been the one that's you know spent the most time with him (sw4074B_0029)
but i i've never owned a cat like that (sw4074B_0030)
i've had cats growing up all the time (sw4074B_0031)
you know they're usually either that way with everybody are friendly to everybody (sw4074B_0032)
so it's a weird cat (sw4074B_0035)
i'm not (sw4074B_0037)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0039)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0051)
so is that is that kind of your child right now (sw4074B_0053)
you feel like (sw4074B_0056)
 uh-huh (sw4074B_0060)
 have you had dogs before (sw4074B_0062)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0067)
yeah (sw4074B_0069)
i just  we've (sw4074B_0071)
i was growing up i had we always had a dog (sw4074B_0072)
and we had mostly (sw4074B_0073)
well not not much but mixes you know like one or one or two mix (sw4074B_0074)
and those dogs i always seem to be the best dogs (sw4074B_0076)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0079)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0081)
yeah (sw4074B_0083)
no (sw4074B_0088)
uh-huh (sw4074B_0089)
 an accident (sw4074B_0090)
from a friend from my my son's friend down the street (sw4074B_0091)
their their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens (sw4074B_0092)
so  (sw4074B_0094)
we i would (sw4074B_0096)
we  we had a dog that was a  mix between a an alaskan malamute than a labrador (sw4074B_0097)
and i should say a pop (sw4074B_0099)
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him (sw4074B_0100)
and we when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get with  you know was pets (sw4074B_0102)
and it was a dog but we got and (sw4074B_0103)
he was just it was just too big (sw4074B_0104)
 the kids can handle it (sw4074B_0106)
i was still going to school (sw4074B_0107)
and my wife was working (sw4074B_0108)
and i was working (sw4074B_0109)
so we just didn't have time to really training (sw4074B_0110)
so he was kind of just the you know it's too big for the kids the handle (sw4074B_0111)
so he was just tied up to a post (sw4074B_0112)
so we gave him too (sw4074B_0114)
i don't know if you've (sw4074B_0115)
there's a place out here on it's called shorty lane out here in (sw4074B_0116)
and they have  (sw4074B_0118)
i guess that's kind of an animal shelter (sw4074B_0119)
he just takes a few of the animals (sw4074B_0120)
sammy destroyed (sw4074B_0121)
in some he keeps (sw4074B_0122)
so we took him up there (sw4074B_0124)
he ended up keeping him (sw4074B_0125)
 that he's had him for six or seven years (sw4074B_0126)
we we saw him just  i guess about a year ago (sw4074B_0127)
and  i thought boy that she looks like that probably gave away (sw4074B_0128)
and so we asked him about it one day (sw4074B_0130)
and he said yeah (sw4074B_0131)
he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life (sw4074B_0132)
goes everywhere with (sw4074B_0134)
he would have been a great great dog (sw4074B_0135)
do you feel like and control (sw4077A_0001)
do you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's licence be required with the other stiff penalties if you're found with like with like you know you know with a gun that's on registered or you know that you aren't license to carry (sw4077A_0011)
i mean it varies from state to state (sw4077A_0012)
there's no national (sw4077A_0017)
me and most states since long as you aren't a convicted felon you know are on probation or a buddy you know other obvious things like that (sw4077A_0019)
 i know i know that like a lot of states you know you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before you know be be obviously insane (sw4077A_0021)
i mean you you have a liver you legal right to get a gun (sw4077A_0022)
i'd probably i'd probably say that you know about about five (sw4077A_0027)
seems like it's a good safe number to pick (sw4077A_0029)
well yeah (sw4077A_0036)
if you ever look at like you know countries that you know where they do have a lot marketing control you know like england and places like that you know the amount of violent crimes decreased by so much (sw4077A_0037)
yeah (sw4077A_0040)
you know per capita murders or you know incredibly low in the united states (sw4077A_0042)
 you know i mean the only problem is you know the beep associated states that he knew he had this you know pretty much on restricted flow of guns going for so long that i think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it'll probably take a long while from take effect is because there's a glut of guns out there already (sw4077A_0044)
it's it's really you know kind of a complex problem (sw4077A_0046)
 i'm not really sure how bad it is (sw4077A_0048)
i've not really have that many problems with it (sw4077A_0049)
but i mean apparently were we were ranked pretty high (sw4077A_0050)
 i mean like i think you know (sw4077A_0053)
i think we've been like rape and like one of the top three for murderers and the last few years (sw4077A_0054)
yeah (sw4077A_0056)
yeah (sw4077A_0058)
i've i've thought about getting (sw4077A_0059)
if i get one i think i'll probably you know get something (sw4077A_0060)
 i wouldn't get ahead (sw4077A_0061)
i'd probably get like a shock (sw4077A_0062)
just for protecting myself you know from you know burglar type thing (sw4077A_0063)
kind of live in the downtown area (sw4077A_0065)
you know what i mean shotguns are are really good because you know (sw4077A_0067)
i mean someone's not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know (sw4077A_0068)
hum (sw4077A_0070)
yeah (sw4077A_0071)
i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like and they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves (sw4077A_0072)
go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through (sw4077A_0073)
they're probably going to miss the purse (sw4077A_0074)
and they're going to like shoot through five walls and hit hit someone you know (sw4077A_0075)
i mean just shut down and just just as struck me as being or you know really good defensive weapon (sw4077A_0076)
and it's sort of pointed somewhere in the direction of you know whoever (sw4077A_0077)
you're pretty pretty much stop them (sw4077A_0080)
yeah (sw4077A_0081)
and the actual shop doesn't go that far (sw4077A_0082)
wall stop it pretty much (sw4077A_0083)
yeah (sw4077A_0093)
this day and that really does scare me it's people you know that have guns (sw4077A_0094)
because if you ever get in a situation where you know you're not prepared to (sw4077A_0095)
but you pick up a gun pointed at the person (sw4077A_0096)
that person russia's you (sw4077A_0097)
you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you just pull the person that you're you're about to kill them and (sw4077A_0100)
 i mean you you you do basically made it clear the person that you know unless unless you know that you're a real danger do them (sw4077A_0103)
and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be doing it stop you (sw4077A_0104)
uh-huh (sw4077A_0108)
yeah (sw4077A_0113)
when it happened like a cafeteria or something (sw4077A_0114)
well  i mean i don't think they've done should be outlawed (sw4077B_0002)
it's kind of (sw4077B_0004)
a lot of the stuff that (sw4077B_0005)
i mean how easy it is to get guns (sw4077B_0006)
and then like with the step for that massacre and killing texas not too long ago (sw4077B_0007)
but i don't really know i mean unless they do i just outlaw him how you can prevent that (sw4077B_0008)
yeah (sw4077B_0013)
yeah (sw4077B_0014)
do you even know what the procedures are now (sw4077B_0015)
it's kind of like if you want to go and you can get a gun especially if you've had the money to pay for it (sw4077B_0018)
yeah (sw4077B_0020)
i didn't know that (sw4077B_0023)
that's pretty scary (sw4077B_0024)
so did now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in writing when did (sw4077B_0025)
i'd probably (sw4077B_0028)
i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better (sw4077B_0030)
'cause i mean i do think that some people need him and like for protection and stuff (sw4077B_0032)
i don't i can understand them wanting to have (sw4077B_0034)
but then again it's just like say all those nut cases out there (sw4077B_0035)
it has (sw4077B_0038)
yeah (sw4077B_0045)
it's a crime that bad there in atlanta (sw4077B_0047)
yeah (sw4077B_0051)
dallas is (sw4077B_0052)
i don't know dallas is the top three (sw4077B_0055)
 do you own a gun (sw4077B_0057)
yeah (sw4077B_0066)
that is true (sw4077B_0069)
yeah (sw4077B_0078)
pretty much stopped well now when i first moved to dallas and moved up here by myself (sw4077B_0079)
 my dad gave me again (sw4077B_0084)
but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it (sw4077B_0086)
so i finally ended up giving it back to (sw4077B_0088)
i don't want to (sw4077B_0089)
we'll be responsible for it because you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i'm not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it (sw4077B_0090)
get it from me (sw4077B_0099)
set 'em off (sw4077B_0102)
yeah (sw4077B_0105)
that's why i ended up giving it back to (sw4077B_0106)
i thought well you know i don't want to know if i don't know how to operate you know but i don't really know how to use it (sw4077B_0107)
i just didn't want the responsibility (sw4077B_0110)
so well  did you hear about that killing match or whatever (sw4077B_0112)
yeah (sw4077B_0115)
what (sw4077B_0116)
kind of i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns (sw4077B_0117)
i'd be scared selling guns (sw4077B_0119)
yeah (sw4079A_0001)
so what  type of  budget do you or your family have (sw4079A_0002)
right (sw4079A_0010)
that's that's sounds like  probably a tighter controlled budget and when i have (sw4079A_0011)
i'm single (sw4079A_0013)
so i guess (sw4079A_0014)
i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget (sw4079A_0015)
but i basically (sw4079A_0017)
right (sw4079A_0019)
i don't need to (sw4079A_0020)
i'm the only one that i have to keep track of (sw4079A_0021)
so it makes it a little bit easier (sw4079A_0022)
 and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well (sw4079A_0024)
and  i kinda i kinda have an idea of what my expenses are (sw4079A_0026)
 i'm pretty consistent per month to month (sw4079A_0027)
you know whenever i need to  you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it (sw4079A_0029)
yeah (sw4079A_0053)
that's (sw4079A_0054)
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more  medium or longer range (sw4079A_0055)
just have a maybe a target amount then i'll say (sw4079A_0056)
probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car (sw4079A_0058)
so i kinda have a an amount in my mind (sw4079A_0060)
 make an effort to salt put a little bit away and you know increase the amount of need for a down payment or whatever (sw4079A_0061)
right (sw4079A_0065)
right (sw4079A_0077)
right (sw4079A_0079)
have you thought about  leasing (sw4079A_0080)
if you're rolling over every three years might be advantageous to do that (sw4079A_0089)
typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make  the best returns after you pay it off (sw4079A_0093)
of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself (sw4079A_0095)
right (sw4079A_0102)
yeah (sw4079A_0103)
mine's  seven years old (sw4079A_0104)
and i think last year was that was a rough year for (sw4079A_0105)
a number of expenses (sw4079A_0106)
but  i'm hoping that most of them were just kind of  (sw4079A_0108)
you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced break shocks and all that (sw4079A_0110)
so i would just went through that whole set last year (sw4079A_0111)
and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow periods before any of that again (sw4079A_0113)
right (sw4079A_0116)
right (sw4079A_0117)
what line of work are you (sw4079A_0118)
well  i don't know that we really have a budget (sw4079B_0003)
i have a set amount that i did i say (sw4079B_0004)
actually actually there is a way we budget our money apparently (sw4079B_0005)
my wife  has so much you know get so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks (sw4079B_0007)
and  we a lot each of us so much money per week for a personal stuff gas and things like that (sw4079B_0008)
and besides that i  you know i have a set amount that i save every every month (sw4079B_0009)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0012)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0016)
really don't need to (sw4079B_0018)
that's right (sw4079B_0023)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0028)
right (sw4079B_0030)
 i found that  you know thing as as i've gotten older (sw4079B_0031)
in my fifties now (sw4079B_0032)
but before we used to have to have to have a very strict budget (sw4079B_0033)
four kids (sw4079B_0034)
and  you know we'd we'd planned out how much you're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that (sw4079B_0035)
kind of anticipate how much things are going to be (sw4079B_0036)
 i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside a like a kind of fence off areas of my check (sw4079B_0037)
for instance there are certain things that i know come up  every so often (sw4079B_0038)
every six months after pay car insurance (sw4079B_0039)
 every six months had to pay my taxes (sw4079B_0040)
so i take a set amount (sw4079B_0041)
i've got a money market account that i do a lot of  saving (sw4079B_0043)
and also get a checking account besides that (sw4079B_0044)
but what i do i'm a money market account off my taxes for instance which amount  an average  two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out (sw4079B_0045)
i put it in print the seats (sw4079B_0046)
take it out of their right mind total and put it in print the season there and let it build up (sw4079B_0047)
every month they had two hundred and twenty dollars (sw4079B_0049)
when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside (sw4079B_0050)
and i guess that's a way of budgeting (sw4079B_0052)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0062)
yeah (sw4079B_0063)
 cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only from buying them but for for keeping 'em on the road too (sw4079B_0064)
 you know we've got two cars (sw4079B_0066)
my wife has a car (sw4079B_0067)
and i like to drive a pickup truck (sw4079B_0068)
so we're on a schedule where i try every  three or four years to to buy a new one (sw4079B_0069)
and you know i'm constantly making car payments (sw4079B_0070)
but i figure that's got to be the story of my life any way of making car payments (sw4079B_0071)
so  you know i get one paid for (sw4079B_0073)
and  actually i'm saving up for another one besides (sw4079B_0074)
so it's you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing (sw4079B_0075)
but you try to try to schedule those things so that  you're you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying (sw4079B_0078)
well i've thought about it (sw4079B_0081)
but leasing wouldn't  (sw4079B_0082)
don't use it for my business (sw4079B_0083)
my wife uses it was just for pleasure (sw4079B_0085)
i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away (sw4079B_0086)
yeah (sw4079B_0090)
i guess (sw4079B_0091)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0094)
right (sw4079B_0096)
yeah (sw4079B_0097)
right (sw4079B_0098)
 i i have been known to keep trucks our cars for  ten or twelve years (sw4079B_0099)
but i find that after about four years they can start going downhill (sw4079B_0100)
you gotta put put stuff into him you know (sw4079B_0101)
uh-huh (sw4079B_0107)
those things can really upsets your budget when they when they come in (sw4079B_0114)
 you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say so that it doesn't  kill you on one month (sw4079B_0115)
okay (sw4080A_0001)
what's your view (sw4080A_0003)
what's your view (sw4080A_0005)
yeah (sw4080A_0007)
yeah (sw4080A_0008)
that's true (sw4080A_0009)
you know even if they give it a shot that still going to be black market all over the place (sw4080A_0011)
i don't know (sw4080A_0014)
coming from texas you're probably (sw4080A_0015)
i don't know (sw4080A_0016)
i shouldn't make stereotypes (sw4080A_0017)
the gun control is probably frown on quite a bit down there i would think (sw4080A_0018)
 you're just living down there (sw4080A_0024)
yeah (sw4080A_0025)
 wow (sw4080A_0028)
yeah (sw4080A_0030)
well i know you feel (sw4080A_0031)
i'm  i grew up in nebraska (sw4080A_0032)
and and we always used to go out and find all the time you know (sw4080A_0033)
yeah man there's no way there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons (sw4080A_0034)
that's just (sw4080A_0036)
i don't know (sw4080A_0037)
yeah (sw4080A_0039)
it doesn't sit with me very well (sw4080A_0041)
i don't know i've any more (sw4080A_0042)
keep a thirty eight and my truck you know (sw4080A_0043)
yeah (sw4080A_0045)
just about all (sw4080A_0046)
well i live in minneapolis (sw4080A_0047)
and i (sw4080A_0048)
well actually i live in florida (sw4080A_0049)
but i'm staying in minneapolis for a year (sw4080A_0050)
and you know both areas are pretty crime written right now (sw4080A_0051)
and it's just you you never know who's out there (sw4080A_0054)
for self protection services (sw4080A_0056)
and then of course there's a hunting shoo (sw4080A_0057)
so (sw4080A_0058)
yeah (sw4080A_0060)
that's good (sw4080A_0061)
but do you do just (sw4080A_0062)
 yeah (sw4080A_0064)
right (sw4080A_0066)
yeah (sw4080A_0068)
i'm a researcher at hunting well up here (sw4080A_0070)
so  (sw4080A_0072)
yeah (sw4080A_0073)
you guys get much of a chance to go out and hunt or anything (sw4080A_0074)
yeah (sw4080A_0079)
yeah that's something i missed quite a bit (sw4080A_0080)
yeah (sw4080A_0084)
alright (sw4080A_0087)
my brother was  a guide for baron all cats out in idaho for a while and  really enjoyed it quite a bit (sw4080A_0089)
but i don't know (sw4080A_0090)
i guess what's the scale now that it's his ear off for  for a complete (sw4080A_0091)
that's right (sw4080A_0093)
i guess i'm about eight or nine (sw4080A_0094)
yeah (sw4080A_0097)
no doubt about it (sw4080A_0098)
but  (sw4080A_0099)
yeah (sw4080A_0101)
yeah (sw4080A_0103)
if there's if there's a way you know to limit it to to people that that i don't know (sw4080A_0104)
they i guess they passed a couple of  of laws here a while back in some states in terms of  waiting period where the you know you go to by hand gun (sw4080A_0105)
and then they actually  (sw4080A_0107)
i know it's just way in florida (sw4080A_0108)
waiting period where you buy (sw4080A_0109)
that's a week (sw4080A_0110)
and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that (sw4080A_0112)
i think that's a pretty good idea (sw4080A_0113)
 and that's (sw4080A_0114)
i don't know (sw4080A_0115)
that's not a bad idea (sw4080A_0116)
but then again you can always get around that (sw4080A_0117)
to to build and see the black market and like you say (sw4080A_0118)
you know you always will be able to get around (sw4080A_0119)
yeah (sw4080A_0122)
it's one of those things (sw4080A_0123)
but  i don't know (sw4080A_0124)
i guess i guess some forms of guns she'd probably be controlled (sw4080A_0125)
it's like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a fully automatic weapons (sw4080A_0126)
i'm just not (sw4080A_0130)
i think those have been pretty much you know ban all together anyway (sw4080A_0131)
it kinda takes the sport out of hunting (sw4080A_0137)
you know it's like well what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or around for a twenty shot (sw4080A_0140)
you know you might do the same thing (sw4080A_0142)
so it's like i don't know i it it does (sw4080A_0144)
takes us four out of it (sw4080A_0145)
for me i'd much rather have a bow anytime (sw4080A_0146)
i i like both (sw4080A_0148)
you know i've done some bell  (sw4080A_0149)
and i  i i get into (sw4080A_0150)
i think it's more of a challenge you know (sw4080A_0151)
but  i don't know (sw4080A_0153)
i guess it keeps the shell makers in business (sw4080A_0154)
but  i don't know (sw4080A_0156)
anyway that's about (sw4080A_0157)
you are (sw4080A_0159)
have you  you eaten yet or whatever (sw4080A_0162)
is it seven o'clock there (sw4080A_0164)
you guys central (sw4080A_0167)
 okay yeah yeah  it's it's not to be (sw4080A_0169)
it's kind of rainy actually (sw4080A_0170)
round this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about  i don't know ten or twenty degrees (sw4080A_0172)
up around forty (sw4080A_0174)
so people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature (sw4080A_0175)
starting them out and stuff like that (sw4080A_0176)
i'm just up here for a year (sw4080A_0179)
kind of a shock (sw4080A_0180)
right (sw4080B_0002)
well i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns personally (sw4080B_0006)
i mean (sw4080B_0010)
that's right (sw4080B_0012)
that's right (sw4080B_0013)
yeah (sw4080B_0019)
it is (sw4080B_0020)
but i'm not really from i'm not really from texas (sw4080B_0021)
just live down here now (sw4080B_0022)
i've lived down here a couple of years (sw4080B_0023)
originally from colorado (sw4080B_0026)
but yeah (sw4080B_0027)
there  there's a lotta hunter (sw4080B_0029)
uh-huh (sw4080B_0035)
i just i i think it's ridiculous (sw4080B_0038)
really (sw4080B_0044)
uh-huh (sw4080B_0052)
right (sw4080B_0053)

  i'm in  program control for a company up here (sw4080B_0063)
yeah (sw4080B_0065)
we do schedules programs schedule programs (sw4080B_0067)
what do you do (sw4080B_0069)
 okay (sw4080B_0071)
 i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here (sw4080B_0076)
on a shock (sw4080B_0077)
but i'd like to go bird  (sw4080B_0078)
yeah (sw4080B_0081)
yeah (sw4080B_0082)
 when i was in colorado we went during you know quite a bit (sw4080B_0083)
one for a total ban and (sw4080B_0092)
yeah (sw4080B_0095)
i'll agree with you there (sw4080B_0096)
i mean if they can anyway get keep criminals from having guns we'll see (sw4080B_0100)
you know i'm not for it (sw4080B_0102)
uh-huh (sw4080B_0106)
uh-huh (sw4080B_0111)
sure (sw4080B_0121)
yeah (sw4080B_0127)
i don't either (sw4080B_0128)
yeah (sw4080B_0132)
boy (sw4080B_0135)
but even  well i mean a semi automatic i guess that's (sw4080B_0136)
yeah (sw4080B_0138)
right (sw4080B_0139)
sure (sw4080B_0141)
right (sw4080B_0143)
 really (sw4080B_0147)
yeah (sw4080B_0152)
sure (sw4080B_0155)
me too (sw4080B_0158)
yeah (sw4080B_0160)
i'm about the same way (sw4080B_0161)
yeah (sw4080B_0163)
 yeah (sw4080B_0165)
it's about seven fifteen (sw4080B_0166)
how's the weather up there (sw4080B_0168)
right (sw4080B_0173)
yeah (sw4080B_0178)
 i get most of my news  from newspapers really (sw4082A_0001)
i read a daily newspaper  the houston chronicle (sw4082A_0002)
and sometimes i'll read  like the  a wall street journal or the new york times (sw4082A_0003)
i don't subscribe to either (sw4082A_0004)
but sometimes i get a hold of copies (sw4082A_0005)
how 'bout you (sw4082A_0006)
do you mostly get news from t v or news (sw4082A_0007)
 that's interest (sw4082A_0013)
you said computer networks (sw4082A_0014)
 what  what sort (sw4082A_0015)
fairly knowledgeable (sw4082A_0016)
okay (sw4082A_0018)
that's interesting (sw4082A_0019)
is it is it the a p news wire (sw4082A_0026)
or is it  something that's that's a little bit different from that (sw4082A_0027)
okay (sw4082A_0030)
so that's that's that's interesting (sw4082A_0031)
yeah (sw4082A_0033)
i've had i had access in the past who   the a p news wire (sw4082A_0034)
i found that was that was pretty  pretty good way to get news (sw4082A_0035)
hum i've ever use the dow jones (sw4082A_0036)
but (sw4082A_0037)
yeah (sw4082A_0038)
that  (sw4082A_0039)
do you get any  do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach (sw4082A_0040)
yeah (sw4082A_0046)
in what way (sw4082A_0048)
and like in sort of like a a  quality or serve the orientation in terms of like viewpoint or the way the news is presented or whatever (sw4082A_0049)
you want them to defend me (sw4082A_0055)
go ahead (sw4082A_0056)
yeah (sw4082A_0057)
liberal type of biased (sw4082A_0058)
yeah (sw4082A_0066)
and  i always notice that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert i find their strip sense to me wrong yeah yeah and they didn't really make mistakes on anything technical (sw4082A_0069)
by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistake (sw4082A_0076)
do you think they're deliberate sorts of things (sw4082A_0077)
yeah (sw4082A_0081)
yeah (sw4082A_0082)
that's disturbing (sw4082A_0088)
i haven't really noticed them doing that (sw4082A_0090)
but (sw4082A_0091)
again i don't watch t v news that much (sw4082A_0092)
if i had access to c n n i would watch t v news (sw4082A_0093)
 i don't know but i don't (sw4082A_0094)
did you did you think that c n n well the gulf war coverage it'd be kind of   abnormality (sw4082A_0101)
i just want i guess (sw4082A_0102)
i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks  you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever (sw4082A_0103)
i guess you would (sw4082A_0104)
it probably (sw4082A_0105)
you just watch it during the gulf war and i probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much (sw4082A_0106)
yeah (sw4082A_0109)
yeah (sw4082A_0111)
actually get most of my news coverage of  computer networks (sw4082B_0009)
however i do also watch television news  use in the morning what's today (sw4082B_0010)
i read the front page of all street journal most every day (sw4082B_0011)
well dow jones for example has a a news wire (sw4082B_0017)
and it's  it's picked up and actually available  at my office (sw4082B_0020)
so it's no fee subscription i'm very easy to to read at my leisure (sw4082B_0021)
 you get started by category (sw4082B_0022)
for example so i can read certain businesses are topics (sw4082B_0023)
well it's similar to that (sw4082B_0028)
but which is  the wall street journal (sw4082B_0029)
 well actually no (sw4082B_0041)
i do follow  (sw4082B_0042)
i don't know how to how to describe it (sw4082B_0043)
so i always have religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense (sw4082B_0044)
it's a weekly but  but not  not like business week or or newsweek or or or one of those kinds of things (sw4082B_0045)
i'd like to say that however  that are overwhelmingly disappointed with media in general except for the rod news wires (sw4082B_0047)
i i think that it i think it has to do with  (sw4082B_0050)
i personally think (sw4082B_0051)
i have a problem with their viewpoint (sw4082B_0052)
and i personally think that  that there's a strong there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media (sw4082B_0053)
yeah (sw4082B_0059)
absolutely (sw4082B_0060)
after all who who writes (sw4082B_0061)
people are journalists who are trained to write (sw4082B_0062)
that's a liberal  a liberal field at least from academia (sw4082B_0063)
and  the only thing that i always noticed is that that whatever they write about something that i'm an expert in i find their scriptures is to be wrong (sw4082B_0065)
and it (sw4082B_0068)
that's right (sw4082B_0070)
well even if it's not technical if it's some social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter (sw4082B_0071)
if i'm expert is that they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in (sw4082B_0072)
they're telling me lies (sw4082B_0073)
i think both (sw4082B_0078)
by delivered  i i mean mistakes omission or  or  biased toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal viewpoint that they have (sw4082B_0079)
so   well give an example we'll go out of the printed media (sw4082B_0084)
i know of cases where  for example in television media where they'll show clippings from one event describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about the same thing they're showing you which is sort of like a deliberate bias  which is which is really disturbing (sw4082B_0085)
a b c does (sw4082B_0089)
yeah (sw4082B_0095)
texas either although i did at one time (sw4082B_0096)
yeah (sw4082B_0097)
did during the gulf war (sw4082B_0098)
and it was addictive (sw4082B_0099)
yeah (sw4082B_0107)
during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks also had regular television programming (sw4082B_0108)
so i've had a particular time you want it to get the latest and greatest news you could do that by  turning on c n n (sw4082B_0110)
okay eric (sw4090A_0001)
 are you married (sw4090A_0002)
and do you have a family (sw4090A_0003)
okay (sw4090A_0005)
and do you and your wife have that that planned for your finances (sw4090A_0006)
uh-huh (sw4090A_0011)
well that's basically what we do (sw4090A_0018)
about every every three months or so we reevaluating our budget (sw4090A_0019)
and we sit down and just right from the largest bills down to the smallest (sw4090A_0020)
and then we there'll be them up between our for pay checks (sw4090A_0022)
i work part time at night (sw4090A_0023)
and he works and my husband works fulltime days (sw4090A_0025)
and so we have the four paycheck (sw4090A_0026)
that works out nice because we get paid every week (sw4090A_0027)
and so that does help (sw4090A_0028)
that helps (sw4090A_0030)
and then  we don't have a lot at extra for extra spending (sw4090A_0031)
so it's pretty well yeah (sw4090A_0032)
earmark (sw4090A_0038)
but  we have found that that works the best (sw4090A_0039)
and and so if we can just divide them up all the major builds up (sw4090A_0040)
in fact we found it easier to divide the major builds up you know cut the house payment and half and cut the lone payment in half (sw4090A_0041)
and by those up between  (sw4090A_0042)
so we're not taking a huge amount of one (sw4090A_0046)
then the next paycheck were real short (sw4090A_0047)
that's true (sw4090A_0052)
uh-huh (sw4090A_0055)
yeah (sw4090A_0059)
it helps you to focus on where you're money goes (sw4090A_0061)
and and i'm sure you felt the same the same frustration before he got on a budget (sw4090A_0063)
but you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in (sw4090A_0064)
and then you're saying my word  that (sw4090A_0065)
does it go (sw4090A_0068)
and also we have found that if we write down (sw4090A_0072)
we did this (sw4090A_0073)
we're not real consistent with this (sw4090A_0074)
but we did it for about a month (sw4090A_0075)
we wrote down everything that we bought twins you know every paycheck (sw4090A_0076)
so we could see where every penny when (sw4090A_0078)
it was really interesting to see just what you do spend (sw4090A_0079)
and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it (sw4090A_0080)
yeah (sw4090A_0081)
we should because it does help (sw4090A_0082)
uh-huh (sw4090A_0087)
stick to that (sw4090A_0089)
uh-huh (sw4090A_0090)
that is (sw4090A_0091)
yeah (sw4090A_0092)
that sounds like a really good idea (sw4090A_0093)
really helpful (sw4090A_0095)
have they developed a savings plan or i r a's or anything like that yeah (sw4090A_0096)
uh-huh (sw4090A_0099)
yeah that's good (sw4090A_0103)
that's a good feeling (sw4090A_0104)
my husband just graduated from university  a year ago (sw4090A_0107)
fine finally getting to that point too (sw4090A_0109)
so are you still going to school (sw4090A_0111)
yeah (sw4090A_0112)
 yes i am too  both questions (sw4090B_0004)
yeah (sw4090B_0007)
we do (sw4090B_0008)
we   (sw4090B_0009)
basically there's the you know expenses that are fix during the month you know the ones that come every every month (sw4090B_0010)
and we  enter that has into  into spreadsheets (sw4090B_0012)
and  what's ever left  after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what what sort of range we're going to generally going to shoot for (sw4090B_0013)
so what do you do (sw4090B_0017)
wow (sw4090B_0024)
yeah (sw4090B_0029)
yeah (sw4090B_0033)
 allocate it out (sw4090B_0034)
yeah (sw4090B_0036)
all the checks (sw4090B_0044)
yeah (sw4090B_0045)
right (sw4090B_0049)
yeah (sw4090B_0050)
we found that  it's definitely helped  get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses (sw4090B_0051)
we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were  spending money for things that (sw4090B_0053)
we'd probably tended to eat out a bit more than that we should have (sw4090B_0054)
it was easy to  let things get out of hand (sw4090B_0056)
we started so that it to be really helpful (sw4090B_0057)
gotten some of our loans paid off early because of this and and stuff like that (sw4090B_0058)
uh-huh (sw4090B_0060)
yeah (sw4090B_0062)
it's a lot of money (sw4090B_0066)
that (sw4090B_0067)
yeah (sw4090B_0069)
yeah (sw4090B_0083)
the other the other thing that we found that it helps if you know we tend to the budget a little bit (sw4090B_0084)
just to  get out the money in advance and put it in   so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever it just put it in a in an envelope or whatever (sw4090B_0086)
and that way it kind of forced us to stick to that amount and then once that was gone well if the entertainment mountainous gone from the mindset i don't know it's gone (sw4090B_0088)
yeah (sw4090B_0094)
we we haven't (sw4090B_0097)
our our initial goal was to retire and debt  completely retire in debt for car payments and credit card a credit card debt and and all of that (sw4090B_0098)
we're just at a point where where we can start thinking about it (sw4090B_0101)
yeah (sw4090B_0105)
uh-huh (sw4090B_0106)
this study (sw4090B_0110)
i'm actually in the in the (sw4090B_0114)
do you like (sw4092A_0001)
i'm more into rock and roll myself (sw4092A_0010)
yeah (sw4092A_0015)
do you like any bluegrass (sw4092A_0022)
yeah (sw4092A_0028)
not really (sw4092A_0030)
wow (sw4092A_0037)
a lot of friends that like country music (sw4092A_0039)
where in tea  older rock like the second alex era like (sw4092A_0044)
late sixties seventies (sw4092A_0046)

you know became more mainstream top forty (sw4092A_0067)
i've never actually seen her in concert (sw4092A_0076)
imagine if you present a pretty good show (sw4092A_0077)
and like some country music (sw4092A_0084)
it's just sort of like finding a lot of it's (sw4092A_0085)
yeah (sw4092A_0087)
mama got ran over by the train (sw4092A_0088)
the garth brooks (sw4092A_0095)
max (sw4092A_0099)
you know like cathy kline (sw4092A_0103)
you know like (sw4092A_0105)
 yeah (sw4092A_0111)
i went to just want to see the grateful dead about like it's about a week ago (sw4092A_0112)
they're still on (sw4092A_0116)
they've been touring late sixties (sw4092A_0117)
yeah (sw4092A_0119)
they're still together (sw4092A_0120)
they're still making albums (sw4092A_0121)
in fact i mean there are people that you know basically just followed them around from city to city on tour selling and things like that (sw4092A_0129)
yeah (sw4092A_0133)
their like late forties early fifties (sw4092A_0134)
you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement (sw4092A_0135)
yeah they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players (sw4092A_0139)
they keep on dying (sw4092A_0140)
and they keep replacing them (sw4092A_0141)
the new ones in his thirties you know (sw4092A_0142)
but  (sw4092A_0145)
yeah (sw4092A_0149)
well they don't actually look it's rough is the rolling stones (sw4092A_0150)
just (sw4092A_0151)
i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the rolling stones when they left (sw4092A_0152)
but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric (sw4092A_0153)
all their faces we're just all shriveled (sw4092A_0157)
just like any if they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and looting (sw4092A_0162)
wow (sw4092A_0165)
yeah i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just  just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know going to la la land (sw4092A_0173)
so  have you seen any concerts (sw4092A_0180)
 lots of different kinds i guess (sw4092B_0002)
 like country music course (sw4092B_0003)
texas (sw4092B_0005)
and i listen to christian music a lot because there's a christian music station here in in our city (sw4092B_0006)
so i listen to it quite a bit (sw4092B_0007)
so (sw4092B_0009)
and i'll listen 'cause on friday nights they have the  they have what they call starting out alive (sw4092B_0012)
or they have it on saturday night friday night saturday night (sw4092B_0013)
and they have christian rock and roll (sw4092B_0014)
so (sw4092B_0016)
you know they have that type of music (sw4092B_0019)
they just have different words (sw4092B_0020)
so i'll listen to that too (sw4092B_0021)
no (sw4092B_0023)
not really (sw4092B_0024)
and i like i like rap music (sw4092B_0027)
you like rap music (sw4092B_0029)
not really (sw4092B_0031)
yeah we're we're together here (sw4092B_0032)
what kind of (sw4092B_0038)
what kind of rock music do you listen to (sw4092B_0040)
do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff (sw4092B_0041)

uh-huh (sw4092B_0048)

uh-huh (sw4092B_0107)
i don't even really know who she is (sw4092B_0108)
you know so no but they've ever been to any of them concerts at you like (sw4092B_0109)
the music you like to (sw4092B_0110)
but aren't they done with (sw4092B_0113)
i thought that they (sw4092B_0114)
 i just thought that they'd done broke up and laugh (sw4092B_0118)
wow (sw4092B_0123)
i didn't know that (sw4092B_0124)
interesting (sw4092B_0128)
to their own up there in age aren't they (sw4092B_0132)
okay (sw4092B_0136)
uh-huh (sw4092B_0138)
yeah (sw4092B_0144)
right because they look pretty rough (sw4092B_0146)
i mean i was thinking like pictures of him (sw4092B_0147)
and they just (sw4092B_0148)
yeah (sw4092B_0155)
i mean 'cause they (sw4092B_0156)
uh-huh (sw4092B_0158)
yup looking i mean (sw4092B_0159)
 are you into that that rock music you know that stuff and all that i mean (sw4092B_0164)
yeah (sw4092B_0168)
i mean like they come on the states (sw4092B_0169)
like you know (sw4092B_0170)
they're not even know that they're you know (sw4092B_0171)
they're just so out of it (sw4092B_0172)
yeah (sw4092B_0174)
so that's why i just don't like you know (sw4092B_0176)
that (sw4092B_0178)
so i don't know (sw4092B_0179)
flew in (sw4096A_0001)
 the other day i attended a conference here in utah state university  recycling (sw4096A_0003)
and  i was kind of interested to hear it 'cause they had some people from the e p a lots of different places (sw4096A_0005)
and  they have basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste (sw4096A_0007)
well it's not too (sw4096A_0009)
well they really didn't propose any solution (sw4096A_0012)
actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a (sw4096A_0013)
but he had a lot of  facts to to give and things like how many solid waste plants for being shut down (sw4096A_0015)
and  one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of newsprint (sw4096A_0016)
he was talking about  the city of new york and how they went and collect did all this news print (sw4096A_0017)
and they could sell it for a while (sw4096A_0019)
able to sell it for some (sw4096A_0020)
now at this stage of the game where they've gotten into recycling neglect is so much news print that they have to pay to have a whole new way (sw4096A_0021)
yeah (sw4096A_0027)
we're doing some here in in cash value of a community here (sw4096A_0028)
there's  you've actually got kind of an i set up (sw4096A_0030)
we've got a couple of plants here that actually take recycled paper and shredded and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation (sw4096A_0031)
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them 'cause they're actually buying and shipping it in from outside (sw4096A_0033)
so one of the real keys it sounds like a getting her cycling of paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you collect today (sw4096A_0035)
and there is a paper presented at this conference and the guy from alabama (sw4096A_0044)
and he was kind of hard to do a study by two department so the government (sw4096A_0045)
one was like environmental protection (sw4096A_0046)
the other one was i can't remember what (sw4096A_0047)
but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff for putting into our land so (sw4096A_0048)
and  solution that he came up with for a plastic and it was really quiet (sw4096A_0050)
he said well the best thing to do with plastics as to burn up (sw4096A_0051)
he came to the conclusion classics actually one of the biggest problems in the landfills 'cause it's it's low weight but it's high volume (sw4096A_0053)
takes up a lot of space (sw4096A_0054)
and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling (sw4096A_0056)
there's a lot of energy and it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity (sw4096A_0057)
so his solution is to burn plastic collecting burn it (sw4096A_0059)
yeah (sw4096A_0064)
and it's more than even paper or something like that (sw4096A_0065)
there's more energy out per pound or whatever (sw4096A_0066)
well that was you didn't deal with that (sw4096A_0067)
just said (sw4096A_0069)
talk about cleaning it up or anything like that (sw4096A_0071)
so it's not very practical (sw4096A_0072)
wow (sw4096A_0077)
 not too much (sw4096A_0079)
i got  (sw4096A_0080)
hello i'm chuck (sw4096B_0002)
 i didn't think that was a new revelation (sw4096B_0008)
right (sw4096B_0010)
so what what is the a p a recommending (sw4096B_0011)
yeah (sw4096B_0018)
 my (sw4096B_0022)
that's a that's a common problem now (sw4096B_0023)
that seems that has happened in dallas is where we're from new york (sw4096B_0024)
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that kind of my house (sw4096B_0025)
and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i could recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose (sw4096B_0026)
right (sw4096B_0032)
well that's good (sw4096B_0034)
right (sw4096B_0036)
has to be   re use for it (sw4096B_0037)
i mean that's why they recycle (sw4096B_0038)
the one i think's the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that  the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers  everything from  wife's baskets too carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet (sw4096B_0039)
and  i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days (sw4096B_0041)
and they're making close out of the recycled (sw4096B_0042)
like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that (sw4096B_0043)
 really (sw4096B_0052)
right (sw4096B_0055)
well it's a carbon (sw4096B_0060)
so that makes sense (sw4096B_0061)
like a carbon she'll have some sort (sw4096B_0062)
but what what about emissions (sw4096B_0063)
okay (sw4096B_0070)
no (sw4096B_0073)
 that's interesting (sw4096B_0074)
 that that was a good day i tell ya conference then (sw4096B_0075)
did it change anything for you (sw4096B_0078)
okay (sw4099A_0001)
talking about exercise  (sw4099A_0003)
 i'm twenty seven (sw4099A_0007)
what type of exercise do you do (sw4099A_0015)
 you do (sw4099A_0017)
yeah (sw4099A_0019)
the difference from aerobics (sw4099A_0023)
the same thing (sw4099A_0024)
and you do that everyday (sw4099A_0030)
 okay (sw4099A_0034)
and this is a club (sw4099A_0036)
do you belong to a a group (sw4099A_0037)
do you go with friends (sw4099A_0044)
go alone (sw4099A_0045)
yeah (sw4099A_0049)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0052)
 yeah (sw4099A_0059)
young mothers (sw4099A_0060)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0063)
 i really don't have  (sw4099A_0065)
i like playing basketball (sw4099A_0066)
we just bought a new home with the basketball hoop (sw4099A_0067)
and that's what i do every day (sw4099A_0068)
yeah (sw4099A_0072)
pretty much (sw4099A_0073)
well my wife last night (sw4099A_0074)
just shoot around by myself (sw4099A_0079)
and that's about it (sw4099A_0081)
i used to play soccer a lot in high school (sw4099A_0082)
when i graduated i haven't done much (sw4099A_0083)
they don't have a problem (sw4099A_0084)
i know i have to do more aerobics (sw4099A_0085)
i don't have a problem with weight (sw4099A_0086)
i could eat all day and not gain announce (sw4099A_0087)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0090)
you do exercise (sw4099A_0093)
to do it (sw4099A_0096)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0098)
yeah (sw4099A_0101)
yeah (sw4099A_0102)
there was telling my waist lines can expand one of these days (sw4099A_0104)
but i don't know (sw4099A_0105)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0111)
yeah (sw4099A_0112)
i guess i enjoy sports (sw4099A_0113)
so that's why i've kept active in that way (sw4099A_0114)
 basketball (sw4099A_0117)
volleyball  (sw4099A_0118)
about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby (sw4099A_0119)
do that (sw4099A_0120)
 i used to (sw4099A_0123)
but you got too expensive (sw4099A_0124)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0125)
yeah (sw4099A_0127)
yeah (sw4099A_0129)
a lot of people do that (sw4099A_0130)
and but i don't know i just never find it (sw4099A_0132)
rather do other things (sw4099A_0133)
 they come up here (sw4099A_0138)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0145)
 yeah (sw4099A_0148)
yeah (sw4099A_0149)
snow bird or out  (sw4099A_0151)
definitely (sw4099A_0154)
 i've never heard of (sw4099A_0157)
uh-huh (sw4099A_0159)
do they exercise much or i mean for skiing (sw4099A_0164)
i know when i when you get (sw4099A_0165)
 yeah (sw4099A_0172)
some of this one or two time or a year if i do go (sw4099A_0173)
i'm really sore after (sw4099A_0174)
yeah (sw4099A_0176)
my legs really really ache (sw4099A_0178)
that's (sw4099A_0181)
i'm using muscles i've never had before (sw4099A_0182)
okay (sw4099B_0002)
yeah (sw4099B_0004)
yeah (sw4099B_0005)
first of all i have to ask you how old how old you are (sw4099B_0006)
twenty seven (sw4099B_0008)
okay (sw4099B_0009)
well i'm quite a bit older than you (sw4099B_0010)
but no (sw4099B_0011)
i think exercise is extremely important (sw4099B_0012)
i do exercise on a regular basis (sw4099B_0013)
well i do  jazz or size which isn't aerobics  program that (sw4099B_0016)
are you familiar with it (sw4099B_0018)
you know national company (sw4099B_0020)
and we have a center here in plano that has classes like all day long (sw4099B_0021)
so you can (sw4099B_0022)
now (sw4099B_0025)
it's really it's it's an aerobic routine (sw4099B_0026)
you warm up (sw4099B_0027)
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobics activity starting you know slowly and then working up to  you know a high heart rate (sw4099B_0028)
and then you gradually go down again (sw4099B_0029)
uh-huh (sw4099B_0032)
i only do it probably two or three times a week (sw4099B_0033)
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week (sw4099B_0035)
well it's really  (sw4099B_0038)
i mean it's it's called a center (sw4099B_0039)
you buy as many classes as you want to at a time (sw4099B_0040)
and then you just go whenever you can (sw4099B_0041)
so like i usually choose to go like at nine thirty in the morning (sw4099B_0042)
or or nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the morning (sw4099B_0043)
yeah (sw4099B_0046)
go by myself (sw4099B_0047)
and that's one of the frustrating thing because i can find very few people to go with me (sw4099B_0048)
and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise (sw4099B_0050)
or they might play tennis (sw4099B_0051)
and since i'm not a tennis player  you know i don't get that (sw4099B_0053)
but i'm you know i'm between i'm in my late forties (sw4099B_0054)
so  there aren't many people you know that want to do that (sw4099B_0056)
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers you know with with children between the ages (sw4099B_0058)
young mothers (sw4099B_0061)
you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find (sw4099B_0062)
well what do you do (sw4099B_0064)
 great (sw4099B_0069)
yeah (sw4099B_0070)
so you play every day (sw4099B_0071)
who do you play (sw4099B_0075)
do you have friends that play with (sw4099B_0076)
yeah (sw4099B_0077)
yeah (sw4099B_0080)
well see that's that's that's really good (sw4099B_0088)
i think that's keeps a lot some people from exercising (sw4099B_0089)
i mean i don't have a problem with weight either (sw4099B_0091)
but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise (sw4099B_0092)
people are always saying to me and how do you stay thin (sw4099B_0094)
it's because i exercise (sw4099B_0095)
but i also watch what i eat  you know (sw4099B_0097)
but (sw4099B_0099)
being twenty seven you know you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet (sw4099B_0100)
but as you get older you will (sw4099B_0103)
well it might not (sw4099B_0106)
yeah (sw4099B_0107)
everybody's been telling me that (sw4099B_0108)
so far it hasn't happened (sw4099B_0109)
and i i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself uh-huh and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high (sw4099B_0110)
yeah (sw4099B_0115)
but you don't play any other sports it basketball (sw4099B_0116)
which do you ski (sw4099B_0121)
being in utah (sw4099B_0122)
 did it really (sw4099B_0126)
cause i know the skiing in utah is supposed to be great (sw4099B_0128)
yeah (sw4099B_0131)
yeah (sw4099B_0134)
well i've never skied before (sw4099B_0135)
but i have friends that go to utah all the time (sw4099B_0136)
i think it's really (sw4099B_0137)
and they (sw4099B_0139)
i guess there's a place where you (sw4099B_0140)
what was it what do you ski from (sw4099B_0141)
nevada to california i guess (sw4099B_0143)
yeah (sw4099B_0146)
thinking about where you can ski over the state line (sw4099B_0147)
there's a there's a place in utah called a funny name (sw4099B_0150)
but it's like  heavenly (sw4099B_0152)
is that it (sw4099B_0153)
yeah (sw4099B_0155)
i think it's called heavenly (sw4099B_0156)
you've never heard of that (sw4099B_0158)
well maybe it isn't in utah (sw4099B_0160)
but they said they skied heavenly (sw4099B_0161)
and you know that they skied really well where they're actually talking about a place (sw4099B_0162)
kind of funny (sw4099B_0163)
 yeah (sw4099B_0167)
can get really score and (sw4099B_0168)
i know you (sw4099B_0169)
neat i've talked to people (sw4099B_0170)
most of these people ski enough so they don't get sore (sw4099B_0171)
one or two timer europe i do go on them really and then is it your your quandary steps that are the worst (sw4099B_0175)
your legs and (sw4099B_0177)
yeah (sw4099B_0179)
yeah (sw4099B_0180)
it's strange that like you can do (sw4099B_0184)
i did aerobics you know all the time (sw4099B_0185)
and then i went horseback riding (sw4099B_0186)
and still i was so silly (sw4099B_0187)
and i couldn't get (sw4099B_0188)
well here in saskatoon  much the same thing (sw4101A_0009)
there is no curb pick up of  any other recycled products (sw4101A_0010)
 we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people (sw4101A_0011)
 there are areas where we could  (sw4101A_0012)
actually we have a couple of the  handicapped societies type of places where they (sw4101A_0013)
one they do is just as a recycling operation and and now there's they  collect the paper and ship it to other retailers (sw4101A_0014)
so  we're able to  have drop off bans for newspapers and cardboard and that kind of thing (sw4101A_0015)
and then there are there's a a deposit program on plastic on glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles (sw4101A_0016)
and so we're able to  take it to one of the  rehabilitation center (sw4101A_0017)
and then they recycle the containers (sw4101A_0018)
they refundable deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container (sw4101A_0019)
and then (sw4101A_0020)
right (sw4101A_0022)
on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing (sw4101A_0024)
and  so they induce recycling of plastic in glass soft drink containers (sw4101A_0026)
 we do have one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept as well (sw4101A_0027)
and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminium pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler  with the handicapped group also accept those (sw4101A_0029)
so  it's fairly fairly extension (sw4101A_0030)
but again it's  it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick out by the city (sw4101A_0031)
well actually there's there's the opportunity for both (sw4101A_0036)
generally the  the handicapped group takes care of the things that (sw4101A_0038)
actually the government has placed a deposit which is the induced went through recycle the bottle so that you get your money back (sw4101A_0039)
and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit (sw4101A_0040)
and then i have  and then they in turn will get some money from the boston area and from the the people that do the counting of the pop and a beer as well (sw4101A_0041)
 yeah (sw4101A_0049)
 i guess partly because of our climate (sw4101A_0050)
here in saskatoon at least in the majority of central (sw4101A_0051)
well i want to say central canada (sw4101A_0052)
central candidates has to be referred more to ontario in quebec (sw4101A_0053)
but  we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people (sw4101A_0055)
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing (sw4101A_0056)
 there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although  scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds  regularly do bottle drives where they go round in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles that individual homes (sw4101A_0057)
they have done it some  (sw4101A_0059)
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting the newspapers (sw4101A_0060)
they're actually it virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls (sw4101A_0061)
there are several containers whereas a group called cosmopolitan industries collects (sw4101A_0062)
where people can drop their use newspapers another papers in the (sw4101A_0063)
and then the bans are collected (sw4101A_0064)
 some of the (sw4101A_0066)
yeah (sw4101B_0002)
 they just  they just started a recycling program here i think (sw4101B_0003)
actually this is my first experience it was like an apartment (sw4101B_0004)
but  instead of dislike tossing everything away which i always felt bad about  i'm starting to split stumped split stuff off (sw4101B_0005)
the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb (sw4101B_0006)
they make me driving like a mile down the road and split it out down there (sw4101B_0007)
what are they doing up there (sw4101B_0008)
deposits only on like drink (sw4101B_0021)
okay (sw4101B_0023)
okay (sw4101B_0025)
 okay (sw4101B_0028)
so is there (sw4101B_0032)
you're given you're you're getting these products to the handicapped (sw4101B_0033)
and the handicrafts kept group is getting the  the money (sw4101B_0034)
or or you get  they somehow distributing the funds back to you (sw4101B_0035)
okay (sw4101B_0037)
that's very cool (sw4101B_0042)
there's  i i heard about it a similar program new york city where  i think it's called like homeless incorporated or something like that (sw4101B_0043)
but what they do is they employ  homeless i think mostly men but homeless people to  go out and collect all of the recycle cans (sw4101B_0044)
and i think it's mostly can't (sw4101B_0045)
there may be bottles as well (sw4101B_0046)
but like beer cans so to cancel it not (sw4101B_0047)
and they  bring them up tall one one centralized location and are are able to collect the money from the various beer and and so the manufacturers and  and and get more money to these people that desperately need it (sw4101B_0048)
yeah (sw4101B_0054)
do they do it with newspapers as well (sw4101B_0058)
 the question was kind of interesting to me because of it just trying to put together a long term financial planning the monthly budget (sw4103A_0001)
the only thing i do now is  put the data in too quick (sw4103A_0002)
i don't know if you're familiar with that (sw4103A_0003)
 i found that it's the only reliable way to keep the checkbook balanced actually 'cause what will happen as my wife or i'll write a few checks and then well  i bother to total (sw4103A_0010)
and becomes cumbersome just to do all the arithmetic (sw4103A_0012)
so i find it helps with that (sw4103A_0013)
 actually we haven't had to  until just recently (sw4103A_0022)
i guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months in another one on the way (sw4103A_0023)
so you just start doing more that just for  you know saving for college and things like that (sw4103A_0024)
right away tried to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that (sw4103A_0026)
yeah (sw4103A_0033)
i guess we're we're just at the point (sw4103A_0039)
my wife work until we had a family (sw4103A_0040)
and then now we're just going in the morning (sw4103A_0041)
so it's more interesting trying to (sw4103A_0042)
find some extremely payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to  (sw4103A_0044)
kind of forced savings (sw4103A_0045)
it'd be interesting to see (sw4103A_0047)
sounds good (sw4103A_0053)
yeah i was just curious what  part of the country (sw4103A_0054)
okay (sw4103A_0056)
cincinnati (sw4103A_0058)
kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people  western accents or something like (sw4103A_0059)
i don't know how many people are are going to be involved in this (sw4103A_0060)
 that's interesting (sw4103A_0061)
   actually i i was kinda interested if you found out about this study they're reading telecom digest (sw4103A_0063)
it was or another (sw4103A_0064)
okay (sw4103A_0066)
that's how i kind of as well (sw4103A_0068)
see what it's based interesting to see how the database (sw4103A_0075)
so i guess we're talking about the experiment (sw4103A_0076)
right try to get back on the topic (sw4103A_0078)
yeah it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to a dollar figures i guess (sw4103A_0079)
i can talk about some of the long range goals (sw4103A_0081)
 well i think either my wife ride like to pursue advanced degrees at some point (sw4103A_0084)
i guess we're off the factor that in if if we're not working for employers that happened to fund (sw4103A_0086)
it seems like every year my employer skills back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement (sw4103A_0087)
they used to reimbursed a hundred percent (sw4103A_0089)
no it's  yeah it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in the class (sw4103A_0090)
and  it's it's a real shift from what we had before  (sw4103A_0091)
yeah (sw4103B_0004)
have some friends of mine who use quicken (sw4103B_0005)
and  i considered using at once myself (sw4103B_0006)
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date (sw4103B_0007)
so i i kinda gave up on the idea of using quicken or at least for now (sw4103B_0009)
i have similar problems (sw4103B_0015)
but  we just have the one check (sw4103B_0016)
we try to keep it up to date as much as possible (sw4103B_0017)
and occasionally i will get behind like you say (sw4103B_0018)
 it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we just remember to keep everything up up to date and balance (sw4103B_0019)
 how do you handle the belong ranger medium range planning on finances (sw4103B_0021)
well that's pretty good if you can do that (sw4103B_0028)
i have a daughter who's ten (sw4103B_0030)
we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point (sw4103B_0031)
but  we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college (sw4103B_0032)
so we're going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall (sw4103B_0034)
and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be putting away for college fund (sw4103B_0036)
our situation it's just a little bit kind of the opposite of that 'cause my wife was not working for some time and it was going to school and just recently  took on a fulltime job (sw4103B_0048)
almost full time (sw4103B_0049)
so it's only recently that we've had the money but we could start putting away large sums of it for a long range goals like college and significant travel and that kind of thing (sw4103B_0051)
wisconsin (sw4103B_0055)
how 'bout you (sw4103B_0057)
 a colleague of mine at  at work got some information over  the computer network called the internet (sw4103B_0065)
and he just forwarded that on to me (sw4103B_0070)
and  founded like it'd be interesting project to participate in (sw4103B_0071)
so i set set back for me now (sw4103B_0073)
what are their long range goals you have besides college (sw4103B_0083)
anyway  (sw4104A_0001)
what i do (sw4104A_0004)
hum at the moment it's utter chaos (sw4104A_0005)
 right now i'm just  (sw4104A_0006)
i i don't really have a budget per se (sw4104A_0007)
i  it's called living within your means you know which means at the moment  paying off the visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse (sw4104A_0008)
 but  (sw4104A_0012)
i don't really have a budget at the moment (sw4104A_0013)
 i have a i have a raw feel for how much money i can afford to spend on (sw4104A_0014)
and then i don't usually don't exceed that unless i unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses (sw4104A_0015)
and then that and then it goes through the moon (sw4104A_0016)
so (sw4104A_0017)
yeah (sw4104A_0020)
so  (sw4104A_0021)
so you can afford to get a house (sw4104A_0028)
yeah (sw4104A_0032)
yeah (sw4104A_0037)
so what do you and your husband do (sw4104A_0038)
are you really (sw4104A_0040)
no kidding (sw4104A_0046)
i see (sw4104A_0048)
overseas where would you be gone (sw4104A_0050)
right (sw4104A_0053)
uh-huh (sw4104A_0055)
how long would you be there (sw4104A_0056)
what was what church (sw4104A_0063)
 yes (sw4104A_0065)
yes (sw4104A_0066)
i  i know who they are (sw4104A_0068)
they  they had an office  in in customer nice as i recall (sw4104A_0069)
and there was  yeah there was a fairly large building that was (sw4104A_0073)
so  are you  are you active in translation (sw4104A_0074)
so  what what languages do speak besides english and of course (sw4104A_0088)
in france (sw4104A_0111)
terrible (sw4104A_0115)
they  (sw4104A_0116)
cause it henry man can said that  they  language is like a like a man slowly bleeding to death (sw4104A_0117)
slowly hemorrhage can to death without new infusions at will eventually die (sw4104A_0118)
and i it it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that (sw4104A_0119)
precept english is just (sw4104A_0120)
takes on (sw4104A_0121)
hello (sw4104B_0002)
do you do with your budget (sw4104B_0003)
yeah (sw4104B_0010)
that's true (sw4104B_0011)
yeah (sw4104B_0018)
that's a real problem (sw4104B_0019)
we're we're trying to  (sw4104B_0022)
so far we're in a clear credit wise (sw4104B_0023)
but the other side of it is (sw4104B_0024)
 not much on that side of it that (sw4104B_0025)
trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that (sw4104B_0026)
but (sw4104B_0027)
i'd like to do that some day (sw4104B_0030)
he has this dream (sw4104B_0031)
but we don't know how long it will be a dream (sw4104B_0033)
we're we're kind of we're really happy that we don't have any pets (sw4104B_0034)
but at the same time we were real scared about incurring it in this  economy right now (sw4104B_0035)
so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month (sw4104B_0036)
were missionaries (sw4104B_0039)
yeah (sw4104B_0041)
uh-huh (sw4104B_0042)
and  it'll be easier once we get overseas because we have  like   support quota (sw4104B_0043)
and it's cheaper to live overseas when it is to live here (sw4104B_0045)
and it doesn't get switch very easily when she come home (sw4104B_0047)
yeah (sw4104B_0049)
africa (sw4104B_0051)
syria (sw4104B_0052)
yeah (sw4104B_0054)
about four years (sw4104B_0057)
korea (sw4104B_0058)
so we we go overseas for for your (sw4104B_0059)
only come back for a year (sw4104B_0060)
go over for for (sw4104B_0061)
come back for you (sw4104B_0062)
 where was translators (sw4104B_0064)
they could very well (sw4104B_0071)
and (sw4104B_0072)
 we will be (sw4104B_0075)
i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step (sw4104B_0076)
you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the teams and assess as the need (sw4104B_0077)
and  came home and got married (sw4104B_0079)
and we'll go back as translators because we want to raise a family (sw4104B_0080)
it's easier to raise a family as translators (sw4104B_0081)
well i always wanted to do translation (sw4104B_0082)
as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier (sw4104B_0083)
you know they really need survey years 'cause you can you're free to travel anywhere (sw4104B_0084)
you don't have kids hanging around (sw4104B_0085)
well i have a smattering of about ten different ones (sw4104B_0089)
but (sw4104B_0090)
i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other (sw4104B_0091)
as i did you know complete a survey in one area it's what's the other (sw4104B_0092)
so i know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff (sw4104B_0094)
but in about  about five i guess i can do better in it (sw4104B_0095)
and my friend has pretty good (sw4104B_0096)
but it's  seven degrees french (sw4104B_0097)
so  terrified to speak it in  (sw4104B_0098)
france (sw4104B_0099)
because they're real snobby about their language (sw4104B_0101)
santa glaze french is street friends (sw4104B_0102)
i just picked it up off the street (sw4104B_0103)
i knew it i was i knew i was communicating (sw4104B_0104)
but i didn't know what i was saying (sw4104B_0105)
never sat there and got a direct translation (sw4104B_0106)
says something here when i came home and friends to somebody (sw4104B_0107)
and said i'm not going to tell you what you said (sw4104B_0108)
so since then i've refrain from t v friends (sw4104B_0109)
i said (sw4104B_0113)
i didn't ask him either (sw4104B_0114)
 so what do you think  about putting an elderly in a nursing home (sw4108A_0002)
that's true (sw4108A_0009)
yeah (sw4108A_0010)
that's true (sw4108A_0019)
never thought of that (sw4108A_0020)
yeah (sw4108A_0021)
until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with (sw4108A_0024)
yes (sw4108A_0027)
really (sw4108A_0028)
they don't like to keep them longer than a week (sw4108A_0029)
yeah (sw4108A_0031)
what do you mean (sw4108A_0034)
yeah (sw4108A_0037)
that's true (sw4108A_0038)
it depends on how how sick the person is (sw4108A_0042)
what you're capable of (sw4108A_0043)
like if you have a family to take care of you know if you're around (sw4108A_0044)
yeah (sw4108A_0046)
 i would personally like it (sw4108A_0047)
my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with somehow (sw4108A_0048)
that's not always possible (sw4108A_0049)
 do the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible (sw4108A_0051)
right (sw4108A_0054)
yeah (sw4108A_0056)
that's true (sw4108A_0058)
yeah (sw4108A_0059)
but i think nursing homes can be good (sw4108A_0061)
just depends on what kind they are (sw4108A_0062)
and you need to check them out ahead of time (sw4108A_0063)
yeah (sw4108A_0070)
yeah (sw4108A_0074)
right (sw4108A_0076)
you know what they're doing with (sw4108A_0077)
yeah (sw4108A_0080)
no my  grandmother is not really a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it (sw4108A_0081)
and she really liked the idea of of moving there (sw4108A_0082)
she's not ill yet (sw4108A_0083)
and  she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years (sw4108A_0085)
and then she decided that  she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she's she doesn't want her family taking care of him being a bird (sw4108A_0086)
she's very independent (sw4108A_0087)
so she's in this nursing (sw4108A_0088)
out in the country (sw4108A_0089)
and  she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook (sw4108A_0090)
uh-huh (sw4108A_0092)
right (sw4108A_0094)
some support (sw4108A_0095)
there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick (sw4108A_0096)
and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now (sw4108A_0097)
and so if she ever does become ill  it'll be like family around (sw4108A_0098)
yeah (sw4108A_0101)
yeah (sw4108A_0104)
yeah (sw4108A_0105)
she loves it (sw4108A_0109)
she's had a great social life (sw4108A_0110)
she travels (sw4108A_0111)
and  it's in in missouri in them in the mountain (sw4108A_0112)
sounds beautiful (sw4108A_0113)
and  i hope that i have something like that i go (sw4108A_0114)
 definitely (sw4108A_0119)
right (sw4108A_0122)
okay (sw4108B_0001)
i think it it varies on on the individual basis (sw4108B_0003)
 sometimes it is there's no alternative (sw4108B_0005)
 you do not have   family available our family that's  (sw4108B_0007)
you may not even have family that is  and then you around (sw4108B_0008)
so sometimes it's not an alternative (sw4108B_0011)
and i think  but i think also sometimes it can be  a benefit if it's for a short time (sw4108B_0013)
sometimes in a nursing home (sw4108B_0014)
 especially after after an acute illness (sw4108B_0016)
to get over a (sw4108B_0017)
to rehab actor an illness (sw4108B_0018)
sometimes you know sometimes the nursing homes are good for  just short periods of time (sw4108B_0022)
because too often the acute hospitals bro you're sending them out and much faster than what they're really able to (sw4108B_0026)
so there is some good too (sw4108B_0030)
 sometimes too it's used as a dumb job (sw4108B_0032)
you know and well the families do not necessarily  know what to do with them (sw4108B_0033)
and they don't want to take the responsibility (sw4108B_0035)
so they'll put 'em in a nursing home (sw4108B_0036)
so you see there's both sides to it too (sw4108B_0039)
yeah (sw4108B_0045)
that's true (sw4108B_0050)
i think that's also who you're going to have a lot of people who are kind of (sw4108B_0052)
there's not a choice because there and it's not economically feasible even to put 'em in a nursing home (sw4108B_0053)
so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the  either medicare insurance to cover it (sw4108B_0057)
so (sw4108B_0060)
yeah (sw4108B_0064)
and then there's also some that are set up for a special tastes (sw4108B_0065)
 i know (sw4108B_0067)
unfortunately some elderly have to go to are have i guess it's alzheimer's or where they wander or  confused or have some mental problems (sw4108B_0068)
and you need a special nursing home for that (sw4108B_0072)
do you need one that has a units locked where they're not able to get out and roam around (sw4108B_0073)
and you need people who are trained for that type of problem (sw4108B_0075)
yeah (sw4108B_0078)
so so there's different types of nursing homes i think (sw4108B_0079)
if they're a little bit of our own independent (sw4108B_0091)
but she still has a a security there (sw4108B_0093)
and i've i've seen some of 'em like that too (sw4108B_0100)
also they have a lot of  activities going on for the ones who are more active (sw4108B_0102)
so it's not sort of like    sick place (sw4108B_0106)
yeah (sw4108B_0115)
i think i think the the  i think the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the  elderly person who is going in and the family that's going to be  effect affected by it (sw4108B_0116)
and  you know sometimes it can those those choices can be made in advance (sw4108B_0120)
and sometimes the choices  because of the nature of the illness (sw4108B_0121)
so am i saying that i i like to have a short work week (sw4109A_0001)
and then we need you know better health insurance and you know (sw4109A_0003)
okay (sw4109A_0009)
okay (sw4109A_0010)
so i just press one then right (sw4109A_0011)
okay (sw4109A_0013)
uh-huh (sw4109A_0014)
well right now i'm i'm just a student (sw4109A_0020)
i only work part time (sw4109A_0021)
i've worked in the job force before (sw4109A_0022)
and forty hours is just too long (sw4109A_0024)
just don't have any time to do anything (sw4109A_0025)
it seems like saturday you'd you'd get off it suddenly you're getting ready for monday (sw4109A_0026)
and if we could have a if we could ever thirty two hour work week or that happened is it for every four people would give another job (sw4109A_0027)
and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay (sw4109A_0030)
and that way that that that would make a a bigger market (sw4109A_0031)
we'd have  more recreation (sw4109A_0032)
people that have time to do (sw4109A_0033)
there'd be less of the stress level (sw4109A_0034)
we'd have less we'd have less crime (sw4109A_0035)
we'd have to have to bill less prisons wouldn't you know less police force (sw4109A_0036)
that's that's that's a that's a possibility (sw4109A_0042)
well one of the problems are facing now a lot of people now is at the health insurance is that the small businesses can or can't offer his health insurance (sw4109A_0044)
and it it it's too costly (sw4109A_0046)
and then what what is happening is that they're on  a policy where they have x amount of of users in it okay (sw4109A_0047)
so they get a specific rate (sw4109A_0048)
well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illnesses and and things like that (sw4109A_0049)
what happened and they were they have to spend that a lot of money for one particular (sw4109A_0050)
it's called a group (sw4109A_0052)
what happens in is that they can't so because they just can't cancel individual (sw4109A_0053)
so that they have to cancel it's just like licensure (sw4109A_0054)
they have to cancel everything (sw4109A_0055)
so what they do is is that they they cancelled the insurance (sw4109A_0057)
and then all of people don't have any insurance coverage (sw4109A_0058)
but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job (sw4109A_0061)
i'm an engineering student (sw4109A_0062)
i work for my instructor (sw4109A_0064)
i'm i'm not typical students (sw4109A_0065)
i'm i'm older (sw4109A_0066)
i'm in my thirties okay (sw4109A_0067)
and so i have a lot of job experience (sw4109A_0069)
and why instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants (sw4109A_0070)
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turned me lose (sw4109A_0071)
and and the same token it's in rarely really enjoyable for me 'cause i don't have to you know nobody breathing down my back (sw4109A_0073)
one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like boss is it that you don't want to yell at you and you know and there are down your back and all this (sw4109A_0074)
i just really can't deal with that (sw4109A_0076)
so (sw4109A_0077)
what kind of what kind of jobs have you done (sw4109A_0079)
uh-huh (sw4109A_0083)
that's great (sw4109A_0093)
have what you might call knowledge power (sw4109A_0094)
when you work at a company whether you know it or not is it your categorize (sw4109A_0096)
some people can be let go and replace like  say   a typist somebody who does data entry or answers a telephone a receptionist (sw4109A_0097)
if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have that you have the knowledge you know at the system you've revise and revamp the system was in your your vital to the company (sw4109A_0098)
and you get more the benefits (sw4109A_0100)
so that's where i'm that i'm i like (sw4109A_0101)
i'm into computers too (sw4109A_0102)
and that's one of the things that i found it in any one of these jobs or anything i've done it have knowledge (sw4109A_0103)
when you have the knowledge you you're not going to  you know be let go (sw4109A_0104)
be one of the last one to let go anyway (sw4109A_0105)
what i (sw4109A_0107)
 okay (sw4109B_0002)
okay (sw4109B_0004)
we can start off (sw4109B_0005)
just get started (sw4109B_0006)
i don't want to you know i talk about it now and then be bored when we get (sw4109B_0008)
right (sw4109B_0012)
yeah (sw4109B_0015)
so you think  i i think in a in a short work week is real nice (sw4109B_0017)
i have a thirty seven hour work (sw4109B_0018)
how 'bout you (sw4109B_0019)
uh-huh (sw4109B_0023)
right (sw4109B_0029)
yeah (sw4109B_0037)
it all makes sense to me (sw4109B_0038)
although yeah maybe more crime i mean if people have more leisure time (sw4109B_0039)
it's not clear (sw4109B_0040)
yeah (sw4109B_0041)
yeah (sw4109B_0043)
uh-huh (sw4109B_0045)
right (sw4109B_0051)
right (sw4109B_0059)
so (sw4109B_0060)
right (sw4109B_0063)
yeah (sw4109B_0068)
yeah (sw4109B_0072)
well i do  research in computer science (sw4109B_0080)
i've just been doing that for a few years now (sw4109B_0081)
so  i my job has most of the benefits of one (sw4109B_0082)
 what i really like is i like being (sw4109B_0084)
like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like (sw4109B_0085)
but  you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of (sw4109B_0086)
they also (sw4109B_0087)
really important thing to me is when they  they pay for continuing education (sw4109B_0088)
like i i get night courses that they're still cover right now (sw4109B_0089)
that's really good (sw4109B_0090)
yeah (sw4109B_0091)
right (sw4109B_0095)
right (sw4109B_0106)
 so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time (sw4113A_0001)
agreed  with with both of those things (sw4113A_0009)
but  do you see any way of life altering it said that they would become more honest (sw4113A_0010)
yeah (sw4113A_0024)
yeah (sw4113A_0030)
 yeah they are probably aren't problem i see would term limitations  is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government and with most governments is just so complex that there is a very low you know that there there is a learning curve and that you know you just can't just send someone off to washington and expect you know his first day it'd be an effective  congress person (sw4113A_0031)
 i think i think there really is  there's a lot that they need to learn you know when you get there (sw4113A_0032)
yeah (sw4113A_0039)
 yeah that's the thing that that  bothers me about our system is just that  for for getting congress the amount of power any any particular congress critter have is based on their seniority and how long they've been there (sw4113A_0052)
so it's you know for you know  (sw4113A_0053)
so unless you have actual you know across the board  limitations the yeah the idea of (sw4113A_0054)
well we're going to see this (sw4113A_0055)
i'm just going to vote vote against the income but every time it doesn't work (sw4113A_0056)
 it was going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time (sw4113A_0057)
yeah (sw4113A_0076)
hello (sw4113A_0082)
i don't see why would make it to be given to the c i a because you know officially they don't do it they don't have any operations within the united states other than (sw4113A_0084)
generally i don't think they are (sw4113B_0002)
 my my personal opinion is that  the politicians are all for their own good because they they're entrenched (sw4113B_0003)
they don't ever have to go out and get a real job (sw4113B_0005)
they just stay in their current job (sw4113B_0006)
you know what i mean (sw4113B_0008)
i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slowed down some of the problems (sw4113B_0011)
 but it has to be not just that the national level but at the you know the state in the local level too (sw4113B_0013)
i know some senators (sw4113B_0014)
and i don't know which one (sw4113B_0015)
but they've been in office the nineteen forties (sw4113B_0016)
and i (sw4113B_0018)
they've never had a job (sw4113B_0019)
i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes (sw4113B_0020)
i know they pay taxes (sw4113B_0022)
but they don't (sw4113B_0023)
you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit (sw4113B_0025)
and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am (sw4113B_0027)
they work less you know less than i do (sw4113B_0029)
i think i think that's true (sw4113B_0033)
however i think that's always been true (sw4113B_0034)
i mean that's true the presidency (sw4113B_0036)
and we seem to be able to get along with the president turn over every eras of four years (sw4113B_0037)
and  (sw4113B_0038)
they (sw4113B_0041)
i mean there is a lot to learn (sw4113B_0042)
but maybe it'll keep them on their toes and a little bit more active and trying to catch up (sw4113B_0043)
i think two years is too short (sw4113B_0044)
i think it has to be extended  (sw4113B_0046)
term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even for terms (sw4113B_0047)
or you would increase of linked to the of each term congressman (sw4113B_0048)
 but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for congress senate and the presidency and then  staggering them so that you don't (sw4113B_0049)
we aren't having a massive ballot every four years (sw4113B_0051)
i think i think that that's true (sw4113B_0059)
but then you have you had the same abusive power on the flip side of the coin (sw4113B_0060)
 the c i a is moving out to west virginia which is they really stupid location or a large agency like that for almost any agency (sw4113B_0062)
i mean the action isn't in west virginia (sw4113B_0063)
i hate to tell this the senator from west virginia that information (sw4113B_0064)
but it really doesn't  (sw4113B_0065)
the world is not revolve around west virginia  as far as this country is concerned (sw4113B_0068)
world does revolve around d c you know as far as politics in this country our concern the national politics (sw4113B_0069)
and the c i a is i've a very large you know very high profile agency (sw4113B_0071)
and to have it located out in west virginia (sw4113B_0072)
yeah (sw4113B_0073)
you know it might only be two hour drive from here (sw4113B_0074)
but that's a two hour drive (sw4113B_0075)
and  you know it it's  i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that (sw4113B_0077)
or is it the f b i (sw4113B_0079)
i don't remember (sw4113B_0080)
but i think there's (sw4113B_0081)
yeah (sw4113B_0085)
that's a fish (sw4113B_0086)
i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true (sw4113B_0088)
but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and  or not having a complete turn over every some small number of years (sw4113B_0089)
i think are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain (sw4113B_0090)
but i think that   it with all the perks that we've given them (sw4113B_0092)
i mean i heard on the radio back a few weeks ago  during the incidents where they were in like they are paying their their restaurant bills and their balancing checks all over the place (sw4113B_0093)
 one of the radio stations over here lifted off every single one of the perks (sw4113B_0096)
so how do you like new jersey (sw4114A_0001)
right (sw4114A_0005)
i guess  i don't know what part of new jersey you're in but i guess it's a fairly industrial (sw4114A_0006)
right (sw4114A_0010)
yeah (sw4114A_0013)
right (sw4114A_0015)
right (sw4114A_0020)
well i don't know about you (sw4114A_0022)
but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor (sw4114A_0023)
i mean you know there's a lot of contributors (sw4114A_0024)
but it seems automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that (sw4114A_0025)
yeah (sw4114A_0028)
that's yeah that's that's (sw4114A_0032)
big issue is you know a lot of states you don't have a  inspection law (sw4114A_0033)
so you get you get a lot of people out there without each year commission control systems on their cars and things like that (sw4114A_0034)
yeah (sw4114A_0036)
sure (sw4114A_0040)
right (sw4114A_0042)
i guess from what i hear though  next year ford is coming out with their electric cars (sw4114A_0043)
they're actually coming out with first prototypes in california (sw4114A_0044)
yeah (sw4114A_0048)
yeah (sw4114A_0050)
i hope i'm hoping that comes along quick (sw4114A_0051)
 i was reading an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going (sw4114A_0052)
and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize (sw4114A_0053)
and i know that's not do that too  it's not due to the gasoline or too you know part monoxide so much as c f c's (sw4114A_0054)
but (sw4114A_0055)
yeah (sw4114A_0057)
i think that's a that's a contributor definitely (sw4114A_0058)
right (sw4114A_0060)
right (sw4114A_0061)
yeah (sw4114A_0062)
i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about a third world countries because i guess the united states and russia has kinda taken a lead in terms of the lemon anything c f c production (sw4114A_0063)
bus (sw4114A_0064)
go ahead (sw4114A_0066)
right (sw4114A_0074)
and that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense (sw4114A_0075)
 in terms of (sw4114A_0076)
exactly (sw4114A_0078)
exactly (sw4114A_0079)
 those are kinda yeah those are joining arguments (sw4114A_0080)
but  i don't know (sw4114A_0081)
that's that's kind of an interesting situation there (sw4114A_0082)
 what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize how quickly the (sw4114A_0083)
i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent of the polls (sw4114A_0084)
and it's it's increasing even as far near the equator is like florida and cuba and those places (sw4114A_0085)
so it's kind of an interesting situation (sw4114A_0087)
not a real good one actually (sw4114A_0088)
yeah (sw4114A_0092)
uh-huh (sw4114A_0093)
yeah (sw4114A_0094)
you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore (sw4114A_0096)
have you been in big cities a long time (sw4114A_0097)
okay (sw4114A_0100)
so you've got (sw4114A_0101)
yeah (sw4114A_0103)
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think (sw4114A_0104)
denver (sw4114A_0107)
yeah (sw4114A_0108)
that's one of the worst (sw4114A_0109)
sure (sw4114A_0110)
yeah (sw4114A_0111)
denver's that that real good at that real good example of sitting in a valley kind of like mexico city does and i guess (sw4114A_0112)
historically been one of the worst in the in the world for that (sw4114A_0114)
but i've been pretty lucky (sw4114A_0116)
i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although  i'm really kind of base in orlando florida (sw4114A_0117)
and there you can tell that it's getting worse (sw4114A_0118)
i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver (sw4114A_0119)
but you can (sw4114A_0120)
yeah (sw4114A_0124)
and there's not that much in terms of  public transportation down there (sw4114A_0125)
there is (sw4114A_0127)
but it's kinda (sw4114A_0128)
it's pretty good (sw4114B_0002)
you get  closer to the  coast (sw4114B_0003)
you do get a good bit of  smog and stuff especially from all the fuel cracking towers and chemical plants (sw4114B_0004)
yeah (sw4114B_0007)
yeah (sw4114B_0008)
when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial (sw4114B_0009)
but  i'm about thirty miles west of there (sw4114B_0011)
so you have  actually green trees and such and you don't notice that that other part of new jersey exists (sw4114B_0012)
actually a very (sw4114B_0016)
you know you you go even a few miles (sw4114B_0017)
and he got the farms and everything (sw4114B_0018)
relatively clear air (sw4114B_0019)
but  (sw4114B_0021)
definitely (sw4114B_0026)
it's (sw4114B_0027)
 you know there are a large number of them on the road (sw4114B_0029)
they're all you know going (sw4114B_0030)
a lot of them are and relatively poor repair (sw4114B_0031)
 he's even where you do have the inspection you know the inspection is once a year (sw4114B_0035)
you've got the car that's in the accident (sw4114B_0038)
buffalo falls off or something (sw4114B_0039)
guy keeps driving along for long periods of time after that (sw4114B_0041)
yeah (sw4114B_0046)
i think also some of the  car companies are coming out with  gas powered flights so (sw4114B_0047)
natural gas powered rather than  gasoline (sw4114B_0049)
it it is coming from the cars though (sw4114B_0056)
i mean the  car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of  the  freon which is one of the major floor glorify floor carbon (sw4114B_0059)
well (sw4114B_0065)
it's the type of thing there that  (sw4114B_0068)
third world countries are less industrial (sw4114B_0069)
and they want to become industrial (sw4114B_0070)
so they're on the different part of the cycle the u s (sw4114B_0072)
the u s used you know all the air pollution and stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today (sw4114B_0073)
or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to boot straps them up to the way where where you got to (sw4114B_0077)
yeah (sw4114B_0086)
yeah (sw4114B_0089)
they also have the very closely related thing of the rain forest destruction which is the main source of what's clearing healthy atmosphere and replacing some of the pollutants (sw4114B_0091)
mostly mostly been in the east coast (sw4114B_0098)
so it's going between atlanta washington d c area (sw4114B_0099)
well not not as hard as some of the places out west 'cause you don't get the  major pollution sources as you do out in denver what the inversion and los angeles and the rest of the california which is just terrible it sounds (sw4114B_0105)
yeah (sw4114B_0115)
yeah (sw4114B_0121)
it's almost all and and be able to 'cause there's not that much in the way of  heavy industry and all that would be causing it (sw4114B_0122)
so how do you get most of your news (sw4123A_0001)
 wow (sw4123A_0006)
so when you say in the morning news or evening news or national news is what (sw4123A_0007)
 okay (sw4123A_0009)
well i would probably be a junkie years watch c n n a lot (sw4123A_0010)
but i don't  i don't subscribe to cable because  the poor service and also  because (sw4123A_0011)
well i  i give the united way (sw4123A_0013)
so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that (sw4123A_0014)
yeah (sw4123A_0017)
take away   diction (sw4123A_0018)
something (sw4123A_0019)
what (sw4123A_0021)
what what  newspapers do you (sw4123A_0030)
for a while there i i i  subscribe to new york times and actually a couple of newspapers because  you know my fiance (sw4123A_0034)
well she was unemployed for a while (sw4123A_0035)
so she you know really need to look at the they want help wanted ads (sw4123A_0036)
and also they they the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of news news (sw4123A_0038)
and (sw4123A_0040)
new york times is okay (sw4123A_0041)
but  i know when you read a lot of this stuff the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so (sw4123A_0042)
 i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level (sw4123A_0043)
but i swear at least second or third grade seven times (sw4123A_0045)
but i don't know (sw4123A_0048)
 i think if you listen to like n p r or something like (sw4123A_0049)
that's pretty good (sw4123A_0052)
 and i like listening to that on (sw4123A_0053)
when i get a chance when i'm in the car long enough time to listen to it (sw4123A_0054)
because i (sw4123A_0055)
well neil (sw4123A_0064)
i guess he's leaving (sw4123A_0065)
one of them is leaving (sw4123A_0066)
 they're they're pretty good too (sw4123A_0068)
 i guess a year ago you're probably watching c n n a lot (sw4123A_0069)
right (sw4123A_0070)
yeah the invasion or whatever it is (sw4123A_0073)
 but i i don't know (sw4123A_0075)
i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype (sw4123A_0076)
look at the  the smith trial (sw4123A_0077)
i mean i was a joke (sw4123A_0079)
n p r doing that (sw4123A_0084)
yeah (sw4123A_0085)
i know (sw4123A_0086)
i had a sewing business (sw4123A_0087)
he knew he was just and just i don't know fixated on that you know just listen to it constantly (sw4123A_0088)
 and i guess that's good when it's alive if you if people really want that (sw4123A_0090)
but that's not really providing you news (sw4123A_0091)
it's it's more like a media event rather than report it (sw4123A_0093)
 really (sw4123A_0095)
it's kind of boring to me (sw4123A_0096)
yeah (sw4123A_0103)
yeah (sw4123A_0104)
i guess that's true (sw4123A_0105)
but  one of the ways that i get information is  every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing (sw4123A_0106)
it's free inside the company (sw4123A_0107)
it's called intellect (sw4123A_0108)
and they basically  type out abstract switch or really literally (sw4123A_0109)
i've i've actually read the actual article (sw4123A_0110)
they're pretty (sw4123A_0111)
now i kind of  i watch the  national news every day for one (sw4123B_0002)
i also read one or two papers a day (sw4123B_0003)
and i'm  i'm pretty much a news junkie (sw4123B_0004)
and i tune into c n n a lot (sw4123B_0005)
every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news (sw4123B_0008)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0012)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0015)
as opposed to paying for cable (sw4123B_0016)
yeah (sw4123B_0020)
 overall i (sw4123B_0022)
the quality of the news you get off of most  sources i would say is pretty low (sw4123B_0023)
it's (sw4123B_0024)
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage (sw4123B_0025)
and that's one of the reasons why i try and get as many sources as possible (sw4123B_0026)
because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope (sw4123B_0027)
still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is (sw4123B_0028)
well i read  the local newspaper (sw4123B_0031)
and i also try and read one of the  major daily is like the chicago tribune or the new york times or something like that (sw4123B_0032)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0037)
right (sw4123B_0039)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0044)
right (sw4123B_0046)
pretty low (sw4123B_0047)
right (sw4123B_0050)
i really like n p r a lot (sw4123B_0051)
right (sw4123B_0056)
yeah (sw4123B_0057)
miss n p r a lot also (sw4123B_0058)
i really liked them because they give a (sw4123B_0059)
instead of being as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good (sw4123B_0060)
and they also (sw4123B_0062)
their editorials standpoint seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing (sw4123B_0063)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0067)
right (sw4123B_0071)
yeah (sw4123B_0072)
sure was (sw4123B_0074)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0078)
yeah (sw4123B_0080)
that was (sw4123B_0081)
but then you also have things where you  where they broadcast  clarence thomas hearings basically the whole linked them which i thought was really good (sw4123B_0082)
uh-huh (sw4123B_0089)
right (sw4123B_0092)
well but the but the new news news that you would get from any other sources being generated from that event which is something that's good also about cspan which i i tune into every once in a while (sw4123B_0094)
yeah (sw4123B_0097)
it is really kind of boring (sw4123B_0098)
but you know that's (sw4123B_0099)
if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned a report somebody else's view about it (sw4123B_0100)
and that's what you're supposed to we're supposed to (sw4123B_0101)
if you watch the news you're going to your opinion is going to be foreign devout on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion opinion which i'm would be much more in favor of foreign my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's (sw4123B_0102)
okay (sw4127A_0002)
i thought it was supposed to get a recording (sw4127A_0003)
but anyway  well i do take care of pretty much all of this stuff for for my wife and for me (sw4127A_0004)
and  i'd embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial (sw4127A_0005)
all we all i do is  keep a list of things like that that  outstanding and you know every two or three months update that and every once in awhile make a list of what we spent that month (sw4127A_0007)
but i doubt i'd do it more than three times a year (sw4127A_0008)
yeah (sw4127A_0011)
no (sw4127A_0012)
i work with them all day (sw4127A_0013)
computer science (sw4127A_0014)
yet i i do everything on paper (sw4127A_0015)
 i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing 'cause it's all pretty round numbers (sw4127A_0018)
yeah (sw4127A_0029)
uh-huh (sw4127A_0030)
yeah (sw4127A_0037)
pretty straightforward (sw4127A_0038)
yeah (sw4127A_0039)
i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff from making you know fancy budget (sw4127A_0040)
it seems like if you're getting to that level you're not real good control (sw4127A_0042)
yeah (sw4127A_0049)
i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bells because that way it's a record of everything (sw4127A_0051)
i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month (sw4127A_0053)
yeah (sw4127A_0062)
that's if that's a week that's a good thing to do (sw4127A_0063)
sure (sw4127A_0070)
do you find trouble keeping records for taxes and all that (sw4127A_0074)
well that's good now (sw4127A_0081)
yeah (sw4127A_0083)
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it (sw4127A_0085)
it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had up having to pay somebody to do it (sw4127A_0087)
yeah (sw4127A_0091)
yeah (sw4127A_0092)
just the forum (sw4127A_0093)
yeah (sw4127A_0094)
yeah (sw4127A_0096)
i don't know a lot of them (sw4127A_0097)
yeah (sw4127A_0102)
i don't trust myself with using a calculator computer too much stuff like that because i wanted to make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on (sw4127A_0104)
i know too many people who use a calculator (sw4127A_0107)
they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention (sw4127A_0108)
and (sw4127A_0110)
yeah (sw4127A_0117)
we have the same thing (sw4127A_0119)
yeah (sw4127A_0121)
sure (sw4127A_0123)
 okay (sw4127B_0001)
they use a computer (sw4127B_0010)
uh-huh (sw4127B_0017)
yeah (sw4127B_0019)
mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when  he was a marine (sw4127B_0020)
went to saudi arabia (sw4127B_0021)
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off (sw4127B_0022)
so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance you know (sw4127B_0023)
so they come in (sw4127B_0025)
i pay 'em (sw4127B_0026)
and that's it (sw4127B_0027)
that's about the extent of it you know (sw4127B_0028)
i don't really have this major budget or anything (sw4127B_0031)
i just really i'm real thrifty (sw4127B_0032)
i'll take care of you know two children and me and  (sw4127B_0033)
just real careful with the money you know what little we had (sw4127B_0034)
so that's what i do (sw4127B_0036)
no (sw4127B_0041)
uh-huh (sw4127B_0043)
you know i mean i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know (sw4127B_0044)
you buy something on credit (sw4127B_0046)
and you paid twice as much for it when you get done you know (sw4127B_0048)
so (sw4127B_0050)
uh-huh (sw4127B_0052)
i don't have too many i don't have too many weaknesses (sw4127B_0054)
but i found out a credit card was one of 'em (sw4127B_0055)
so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person (sw4127B_0057)
it's like  well that's on sale (sw4127B_0058)
let's go grab it you know (sw4127B_0059)
so  and if you don't have the money then use the (sw4127B_0060)
so i got rid of them credit cards i guess is  you know (sw4127B_0061)
yeah (sw4127B_0064)
was my weakness (sw4127B_0065)
wasn't bad (sw4127B_0066)
i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that (sw4127B_0067)
just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know (sw4127B_0068)
so but i self employed you know (sw4127B_0071)
i have my own little cleaning business type thing (sw4127B_0072)
so  (sw4127B_0073)
no (sw4127B_0076)
it's not hard (sw4127B_0077)
just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and  you know what it's going to have to go for that month (sw4127B_0078)
you know it's not that not that hard not at all (sw4127B_0079)
so i always do my own income tax you know (sw4127B_0082)
do you (sw4127B_0084)
i do read a book i made read the little book they say (sw4127B_0089)
smell in the blanks and go (sw4127B_0090)
i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to (sw4127B_0095)
it's  (sw4127B_0098)
i guess if you had some really complicated stuff (sw4127B_0099)
but i don't (sw4127B_0100)
so i don't mess with it (sw4127B_0101)
but i'll use a calculator either (sw4127B_0103)
i don't i don't have that much that many you know things to add up (sw4127B_0105)
so (sw4127B_0106)
 yeah (sw4127B_0109)
and we have (sw4127B_0111)
i may get antsy and be here (sw4127B_0112)
and they have a number that you can call in (sw4127B_0113)
i always call in like once every other week or so (sw4127B_0114)
and i will  check off what checks of (sw4127B_0115)
yeah (sw4127B_0116)
do you do that (sw4127B_0118)
you did too (sw4127B_0120)
and i always check 'em off and you know check my balance in my book and you know 'cause i always wanted to know exactly what i have you know (sw4127B_0122)
i do that real often (sw4127B_0124)
i do that (sw4127B_0125)
so anyway (sw4127B_0126)
so what are what are your views on capital punishment (sw4129A_0002)
yes (sw4129A_0006)
so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state (sw4129A_0009)
yes (sw4129A_0013)
that is similar to georgia (sw4129A_0014)
that's probably true considering (sw4129A_0017)
yes (sw4129A_0018)
yes (sw4129A_0019)
 i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if (sw4129A_0020)
yes (sw4129A_0022)
that would be the intent of it (sw4129A_0024)
i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals (sw4129A_0027)
yeah (sw4129A_0030)
if if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment (sw4129A_0031)
 i'm a research engineer (sw4129A_0034)
i work with georgia tech (sw4129A_0035)
yes (sw4129A_0039)
that's probably true (sw4129A_0047)
but i guess there's other factors (sw4129A_0048)
put pumping more money to the school system is a good thing (sw4129A_0050)
but it's not going to (sw4129A_0052)
i see (sw4129A_0053)
so that's a difficult situation (sw4129A_0066)
that's probably true (sw4129A_0081)
yeah (sw4129A_0082)
yeah (sw4129A_0084)
i guess that's not an easy solution (sw4129A_0085)
there's no easy solution for that (sw4129A_0086)
i'm sure it is (sw4129A_0093)
yeah (sw4129A_0094)
yeah (sw4129A_0096)
i don't i don't (sw4129A_0097)
certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems (sw4129A_0098)
but (sw4129A_0100)
i guess i am for certain (sw4129A_0104)
yeah (sw4129A_0106)
certain crimes (sw4129A_0107)
 premeditated murder crimes of that nature i think should definitely (sw4129A_0109)
any mass murder type individual (sw4129A_0111)
 you always have (sw4129A_0115)
yes (sw4129A_0117)
i read about that (sw4129A_0118)
i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of a deterrent we would like to think it is (sw4129B_0003)
that on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain (sw4129B_0004)
texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country (sw4129B_0005)
and it's eating out is alive budget wise (sw4129B_0007)
and  (sw4129B_0008)
yeah (sw4129B_0010)
we do practice capital punishment (sw4129B_0011)
but the nature of the courts and the appeals in the states and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever execute (sw4129B_0012)
yeah (sw4129B_0015)
and then i was reading in the paper just this morning was interesting 'cause i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this low topic damn that it costs more to execute somebody that than it does to keep 'em that's probably true because of all the cost of the appeals and all that you know (sw4129B_0016)
well i think the capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people yeah you know who would see it (sw4129B_0021)
yeah (sw4129B_0025)
i'm not sure how successful at it (sw4129B_0026)
quicker maybe (sw4129B_0028)
yeah (sw4129B_0029)
what kind of work eat it (sw4129B_0033)
 well see i'm a school principal (sw4129B_0036)
elementary school (sw4129B_0038)
and in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo period (sw4129B_0040)
i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do (sw4129B_0041)
and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people (sw4129B_0043)
'course you couldn't do that 'cause you gotta do something with the ones that are over there (sw4129B_0044)
i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids we'd have fewer decisions tonight that's probably true down the road you know (sw4129B_0046)
 yeah (sw4129B_0049)
but i'm not talking about just in a school system (sw4129B_0051)
see i'm talking about (sw4129B_0054)
in in (sw4129B_0055)
i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just i'll be tightened out or at home and reared (sw4129B_0056)
i know his decisions don't work that (sw4129B_0057)
but there's a bad day i had all these kids through my office (sw4129B_0058)
i have a school or five hundred and thirty seven kids (sw4129B_0059)
five hundred of 'em are good solid case (sw4129B_0061)
and i have the same thirty seven in the office every day (sw4129B_0062)
a lot of their parents are totally (sw4129B_0064)
some of them in the penal system (sw4129B_0065)
and you know you just see those kids going down the road (sw4129B_0067)
not all of them will commit offensive it have to do with capital punishment (sw4129B_0068)
but some of them i've already been and youth centers and that kind of thing (sw4129B_0069)
and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminal (sw4129B_0071)
and i'm not talking about necessary in the school system (sw4129B_0072)
i'm not sure that the school system should be the asian of all the social action (sw4129B_0073)
i think that's one reason we have problems in school  (sw4129B_0075)
some of our problems (sw4129B_0076)
but a lot of it's because everything's society wants we are supposed to do (sw4129B_0077)
that's another subject (sw4129B_0079)
that (sw4129B_0080)
anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up with somebody who's making the decision what to do with (sw4129B_0083)
i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution (sw4129B_0088)
if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be it would be money better spent (sw4129B_0089)
 it costs more to keep an inmate on death row and they'll send a kid (sw4129B_0091)
that's true (sw4129B_0092)
statistically that is true (sw4129B_0095)
i'm all right how are you in some cases (sw4129B_0103)
yeah (sw4129B_0105)
kind of crimes what'd you do use it for (sw4129B_0108)
i would consider it for sexual abuse of children ongoing you know not one instance the perpetual what these are the children (sw4129B_0112)
well you know somebody elected that recently (sw4129B_0116)
and all the better too (sw4129B_0119)
yeah (sw4129B_0121)
so julie how do you feel about aids research (sw4130A_0001)
agreed (sw4130A_0003)
i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense and that you know  (sw4130A_0004)
made it even better economic sense to did too we had a lot more research tunnel longer ago (sw4130A_0005)
you know because you know because  the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patience (sw4130A_0009)
i think they cover eight (sw4130A_0015)
but what they do is  if you apply for for to get a entrance policy they'll  check to see if you're h i v positive (sw4130A_0016)
and if you are not only will they not give you  a policy (sw4130A_0018)
but they'll  they have like (sw4130A_0019)
like you know database of people that have tested positive (sw4130A_0020)
you'll never be able to get insurance ever again (sw4130A_0021)
yeah (sw4130A_0024)
i think a lot of it was it was just that you know because because of of the audience you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were people that no one really cared about (sw4130A_0025)
that (sw4130A_0028)
yeah (sw4130A_0033)
when it when when you get when humorous retard i heard her to someone who claim that you know aids was you know god's punishment was that than lesbians must be god's chosen people (sw4130A_0035)
but  (sw4130A_0038)
so  (sw4130A_0041)
 do you think do you mean do you think we are actually doing enough right now too (sw4130A_0043)
private organizations (sw4130A_0050)
i mean it seems that you know it's just you know it's just an to reach a steady a steady stayed a little light lot higher point that it will we you know we'd nip it in the bud you quote barney fife (sw4130A_0058)
uh-huh (sw4130A_0067)
i would probably agree with that (sw4130A_0069)
 so do you think it's more important to spend money on researcher for support of  people (sw4130A_0072)
yeah (sw4130A_0082)
i think it's i think tend to really interesting question of  (sw4130A_0090)
i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely (sw4130B_0002)
 yeah (sw4130B_0006)
yeah (sw4130B_0007)
for sure (sw4130B_0008)
exactly (sw4130B_0010)
exactly (sw4130B_0012)
does does like do the health insurance policies like for companies and things (sw4130B_0013)
did they cover diseases like that (sw4130B_0014)
uh-huh (sw4130B_0017)
 well that's but that's why they should have started doing stuff before (sw4130B_0022)
i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time they're still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are dreaming a lot of money right now you know (sw4130B_0023)
right (sw4130B_0026)
right (sw4130B_0027)
right (sw4130B_0029)
and all these god fearing people were like well you know god is trying to kill awful center (sw4130B_0030)
yeah (sw4130B_0037)
yeah (sw4130B_0039)
it gives them (sw4130B_0040)
uh-huh (sw4130B_0044)
really (sw4130B_0045)
i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff (sw4130B_0046)
 really we're not doing much at all (sw4130B_0047)
most of what gets raised me it's not really federal movements (sw4130B_0048)
most of what gets raised gets raised by   you know conscious yeah communities and things like that you know (sw4130B_0049)
like  san francisco has a a real  strong aids support group and all that kinda stuff (sw4130B_0052)
and  get they get donations from the community you know they're real and from corporations around the around the city for aids research and that kind of thing (sw4130B_0053)
and  i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominantly so far because it's you know it's bound to spread (sw4130B_0056)
right (sw4130B_0059)
yeah (sw4130B_0060)
i don't know (sw4130B_0061)
i don't know (sw4130B_0062)
i i don't know what the likelihood of that is (sw4130B_0063)
there you know people really waking up (sw4130B_0064)
especially with the ultra conservative move our our political system sort of seems to be taken (sw4130B_0066)
yeah (sw4130B_0070)
that's a good question fish (sw4130B_0074)
i don't know (sw4130B_0075)
 i think i think one of the main thing is is really important to spend money on his education not support or or research per se but but education because a lotta people sort of get drummed out of the work place in our society and it kind of like lepers would you know (sw4130B_0076)
and it's really it's it's really not necessary  until until the disease reaches his final station it becomes really infectious (sw4130B_0079)
and   i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely cut off from from community (sw4130B_0081)
and that and  i don't know (sw4130B_0084)
i think that that  research is i guess the most important just because i you know it it really needs to come to an end yeah (sw4130B_0085)
i don't know (sw4130B_0087)
 no (sw4130B_0088)
what do you think about that subject (sw4130B_0089)
so  yeah my feeling is that  it's really being used today (sw4133A_0001)
you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time that people end up waiting on appeal (sw4133A_0002)
right (sw4133A_0005)
because you've you've got all all the expensive plus i'm a legal expenses (sw4133A_0006)
 and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent  for one thing because it's used so infrequently in front of everything because i honestly don't think the people that are committed a couple of crimes rent would be eligible you know really care (sw4133A_0008)
it's kinda like the aids phenomenon (sw4133A_0014)
 invulnerable (sw4133A_0015)
i don't need to care about this (sw4133A_0016)
you know i i i'm never going to get caught (sw4133A_0017)
yeah (sw4133A_0025)
one way or another (sw4133A_0026)
yeah (sw4133A_0028)
but the other side to that is if you put them in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know somehow redeem himself (sw4133A_0029)
well you know some of it you know (sw4133A_0033)
the question is you know the proper capital punishment and you run into is what are you going to do about people who are later found proven innocent (sw4133A_0034)
there are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact of getting evidence especially is new technology comes along with my prove their innocence you know some (sw4133A_0035)
i guess we killed her on (sw4133A_0036)
yeah (sw4133A_0041)
you can apologize nicely (sw4133A_0042)
but you know you know i think you know the price (sw4133A_0043)
i've heard court you know it's better than a thousand people go three than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think is really the philosophy of the way our legal system works (sw4133A_0044)
yeah (sw4133A_0049)
you know i i think that (sw4133A_0050)
the way it's being is now it's like you listen to bush is you know (sw4133A_0051)
where we go to impose (sw4133A_0052)
drug dealers as new big thing (sw4133A_0053)
song us is also saying you know capital making a capital crime to be a major drug dealer (sw4133A_0054)
and again i don't think these people (sw4133A_0056)
risk their lives every day (sw4133A_0057)
and and you know  especially in i live in massachusetts (sw4133A_0062)
we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something (sw4133A_0063)
so you know (sw4133A_0065)
but you look at our crime rates and things like that and you compare him to like texas or someplace with us you know it's it's impossible to make a case but it's it's affecting it in any way (sw4133A_0066)
i think it's mainly people like they did the vengeance of it (sw4133A_0068)
uh-huh (sw4133A_0071)
yeah (sw4133A_0075)
it's been a lot of blacks (sw4133A_0076)
so a lot of young people (sw4133A_0077)
you know  sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen (sw4133A_0078)
you know i i think when you listen to like the  the the victims families and things they're always talking about you know that feeling justified or feeling you know like they have gotten the something out of it (sw4133A_0080)
i mean once the guy who's been in prison if he goes to jail forever or whatever if he gets killed it shouldn't make a difference to the  to the victim's family (sw4133A_0081)
the only thing that should really (sw4133A_0082)
i mean obviously if someone of mine who was closed died i probably feel differently (sw4133A_0083)
but you know that you know what the important thing is if they'd be caught and not be a danger to society (sw4133A_0084)
right (sw4133A_0093)
and the other thing is that  you know (sw4133A_0094)
i was reading through a book on  do you know human genome research (sw4133A_0095)
and they'll more and more things like schizophrenia (sw4133A_0097)
and wise or turn out to be genetic or bio chemical and origin (sw4133A_0098)
so some day we can go to and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance (sw4133A_0100)
and you know if you take this regularly there'll be a say in them productive member of society (sw4133A_0101)
really get back to the question of you know if someone responsible for their actions (sw4133A_0103)
society made me do it (sw4133A_0107)
right (sw4133B_0003)
i think i've seen some statistics that say that  it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life (sw4133B_0004)
 that's (sw4133B_0009)
committing a mostly as you know their crimes of passion or at the moment (sw4133B_0010)
they think they're not going to get caught (sw4133B_0011)
yeah (sw4133B_0018)
yeah (sw4133B_0019)
yeah (sw4133B_0020)
we also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis (sw4133B_0021)
for example someone like  jeffrey (sw4133B_0022)
do you want (sw4133B_0023)
by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again (sw4133B_0024)
whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility (sw4133B_0027)
don't think he could ever redeem themselves (sw4133B_0031)
in some cases yeah (sw4133B_0032)
yeah (sw4133B_0037)
it's it's (sw4133B_0038)
once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it (sw4133B_0040)
yeah (sw4133B_0047)
the benefit of the doubt to the last is  based on the person who was accused (sw4133B_0048)
yeah (sw4133B_0058)
they're they're they say that the profit margin and drug dealers the profit margins so high that yeah the risk is almost not there (sw4133B_0059)
well it's also (sw4133B_0070)
loose to live in georgia (sw4133B_0072)
you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment (sw4133B_0073)
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related (sw4133B_0074)
that (sw4133B_0087)
you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility that we don't currently do this of making restitution (sw4133B_0088)
you will work you're prison job (sw4133B_0091)
any money you earn we'll go to the victim's family (sw4133B_0092)
right (sw4133B_0099)
i think on some of it you have to say someone's response was acting (sw4133B_0105)
never liked the  well i never liked the insanity defense (sw4133B_0106)
let's see (sw4137A_0001)
it's pretty easy actually (sw4137A_0002)
 i just got done reading a magazine or a couple of magazine articles about the  new saturn (sw4137A_0003)
and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one (sw4137A_0005)
yeah (sw4137A_0009)
no (sw4137A_0011)
so that fact (sw4137A_0012)
it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money (sw4137A_0013)
i'm interested in having it for  doing a little odd across racing  close circuit racing (sw4137A_0014)
and  it seems just blow the competition away (sw4137A_0016)
handling power everything (sw4137A_0018)
just got like the (sw4137A_0020)
it was compared up against  (sw4137A_0021)
let's see (sw4137A_0022)
it was like mazda and mix three  nissan whatever the tooth and x two thousand civic outside (sw4137A_0023)
and it just you know it it dominated over all of them (sw4137A_0024)
everybody all the raiders loved it (sw4137A_0025)
i like the i like the styling (sw4137A_0026)
and i've seen a few of them actually race (sw4137A_0027)
and they seem to be really good cars for it (sw4137A_0028)
well thank you (sw4137A_0030)
can't afford it (sw4137A_0031)
right (sw4137A_0034)
yeah (sw4137A_0035)
i'm a graduate student (sw4137A_0036)
let's face it (sw4137A_0037)
i don't make any money (sw4137A_0038)
yeah (sw4137A_0039)
yeah (sw4137A_0044)
yeah (sw4137A_0045)
well see then (sw4137A_0046)
and (sw4137A_0047)
right now i'm stuck (sw4137A_0048)
i've got a a pontiac sunbird terrible that (sw4137A_0049)
it's fast but unreliable (sw4137A_0050)
trying to get it prepared for racing (sw4137A_0051)
but it it'd be nice just like scrap it and go for like a saturday (sw4137A_0052)
 yeah (sw4137A_0055)
do i use it for both (sw4137A_0056)
the nice thing about auto crossing as you can you can do both (sw4137A_0057)
it's just like   set up a lot of times (sw4137A_0060)
just like really large  parking lots and and things (sw4137A_0061)
tight turns part acceleration (sw4137A_0065)
i spend a lotta mustangs compete (sw4137A_0066)
and it's interesting (sw4137A_0067)
they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in the class (sw4137A_0068)
yeah (sw4137A_0070)
 what are you thinking about buying (sw4137A_0073)
the legend (sw4137A_0076)
yeah (sw4137A_0082)
yeah (sw4137A_0083)
i was i was actually in (sw4137A_0084)
a lot of b m w's are produced in   and  in munich (sw4137A_0085)
and i was i was there this summer (sw4137A_0087)
and i i was really impressed by the  the factory  tourist and such for b m w (sw4137A_0088)
yeah (sw4137A_0093)
 of course (sw4137A_0096)
of course (sw4137A_0097)
they want you to buy their car (sw4137A_0098)
was it was interesting (sw4137A_0101)
 i also went to other porsche (sw4137A_0102)
and  it was it was amazing how they were completely oppose (sw4137A_0103)
yeah (sw4137A_0105)
 the b m w is really like  we have all these like high tech things (sw4137A_0106)
everything is put together with exacting tolerances (sw4137A_0107)
and then you go to porsche (sw4137A_0108)
and it's like well  these cars are completely handmade (sw4137A_0109)
and no two of them are like (sw4137A_0111)
so it's like completely opposed (sw4137A_0115)
which do i like better (sw4137A_0117)
i think i liked that forces philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical (sw4137A_0118)
unless you it's it's a toy (sw4137A_0121)
let's face it (sw4137A_0124)
yeah (sw4137A_0125)
b m w is good for that (sw4137A_0127)
what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do use it for (sw4137A_0128)
yeah (sw4137A_0132)
that's cool (sw4137A_0134)
yeah (sw4137A_0137)
that's good (sw4137A_0138)
i also i was impressed by  by the mercedes too (sw4137A_0139)
i really i really liked the mercedes (sw4137A_0141)
the factory was nice (sw4137A_0144)
and it's a different for the for the b m w (sw4137A_0146)
probably (sw4137A_0149)
right (sw4137A_0150)
i can imagine that (sw4137A_0151)
uh-huh (sw4137B_0004)
 really (sw4137B_0006)
like  (sw4137B_0007)
so you're an american (sw4137B_0008)
you want to buy american (sw4137B_0010)
in terms of handling  celery (sw4137B_0017)
what about mustang g t (sw4137B_0029)
but (sw4137B_0032)
so you're talking about one's in a lower lower and (sw4137B_0033)
right (sw4137B_0040)
well you what do you graduate (sw4137B_0041)
plenty of money (sw4137B_0042)
by whatever you want (sw4137B_0043)
right (sw4137B_0053)
do you use that for city driving in racing (sw4137B_0054)
auto crossing is (sw4137B_0058)
what kind of (sw4137B_0059)
okay (sw4137B_0062)
and you put up the set up the trip (sw4137B_0063)
okay (sw4137B_0064)
 really (sw4137B_0069)
i would guess so (sw4137B_0072)
 i think i'd like to get a b m w or if i go to the german route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but  or maybe a i mean   accurate legend (sw4137B_0074)
alexis  s c three hundred maybe something on that (sw4137B_0078)
i haven't really determined if i like the the japanese were the if i like them enough to purchase one (sw4137B_0080)
you know 'cause you're b m w german cars have good reputations i think (sw4137B_0081)
yes (sw4137B_0086)
yeah (sw4137B_0089)
yeah (sw4137B_0090)
they they're they have the whole philosophy (sw4137B_0091)
i mean they they kinda even brainwashed themselves into thinking they're better which is kinda hard to take (sw4137B_0092)
i mean if you're walking through that little tour in munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too (sw4137B_0094)
 really (sw4137B_0104)
that's (sw4137B_0114)
no (sw4137B_0119)
it's not realistic (sw4137B_0120)
yeah (sw4137B_0122)
you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess (sw4137B_0123)
yeah (sw4137B_0129)
just work short trips no no heavy mild (sw4137B_0130)
putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year (sw4137B_0131)
so it's pretty minimal (sw4137B_0133)
last a long time (sw4137B_0135)
that's mainly what i'm looking for (sw4137B_0136)
 yeah (sw4137B_0140)
but but if if you have a problem with a mercedes you take it into a shop (sw4137B_0142)
they're going to they're going to hit you out for just all kinds of things (sw4137B_0143)
 i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different (sw4137B_0147)
once you get up at five series and higher then all your appear costs go up significantly (sw4137B_0148)
so i'm (sw4137B_0152)
i'm not sure if i really want (sw4137B_0154)
about  texas (sw4138A_0001)
spend what you have (sw4138A_0005)
yeah (sw4138A_0007)
i think that the general idea of just you know spend  during that time of recession that you know for the death suspending to help pick up the economy (sw4138A_0008)
but they're running under the assumption (sw4138A_0009)
you know the way they're running it now they're you know running on it or a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession (sw4138A_0010)
so there's never any surplus coming into counter the deficit that were running (sw4138A_0011)
so i've kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt (sw4138A_0012)
you're not going to pay off what you  (sw4138A_0013)
so i guess the question was more like  do get what you pay you know get what you pay for (sw4138A_0014)
yeah (sw4138A_0020)
i agree with that (sw4138A_0025)
i guess (sw4138A_0027)
 i'm a student right now (sw4138A_0028)
i don't make a whole lot of money (sw4138A_0029)
so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes too i guess  compared to what i get 'cause i you know my my education is state sponsored (sw4138A_0030)
i go to a state sponsored school (sw4138A_0031)
and  my education all up through high school and stuff (sw4138A_0032)
so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose 'cause i haven't been paying taxes all that all that long (sw4138A_0033)
my parents i guess however contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything (sw4138A_0034)
but  i usually end up getting money back (sw4138A_0035)
well this year anyway from (sw4138A_0036)
yeah (sw4138A_0038)
yeah (sw4138A_0039)
i need it too (sw4138A_0040)
uh-huh (sw4138A_0048)
more taxes you pay (sw4138A_0051)
uh-huh (sw4138A_0054)
yeah (sw4138A_0055)
uh-huh (sw4138A_0058)
wow (sw4138A_0061)
what was it (sw4138A_0064)
there's a lot yeah a lot of hidden taxes (sw4138A_0067)
the taxes that people don't think about (sw4138A_0070)
yeah (sw4138A_0071)
but the the income tax was a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess (sw4138A_0072)
uh-huh (sw4138A_0074)
there was that (sw4138A_0075)
which (sw4138A_0076)
was it gerry brown (sw4138A_0077)
the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes that have now and implementing us i think a flat percentage something like that (sw4138A_0078)
right (sw4138A_0085)
exactly (sw4138A_0086)
'cause up until like eight (sw4138A_0087)
up until like eighty five or something what (sw4138A_0091)
well i think they're a necessary evil (sw4138B_0002)
i wish the government would operate on the same premise that  businesses operate on (sw4138B_0003)
and that is  is that what you have you don't spend more than you then you bring in (sw4138B_0004)
well (sw4138B_0015)
it just depends (sw4138B_0016)
  roads are very expensive a commodity (sw4138B_0017)
so is  utilities they supply and police and fire department (sw4138B_0018)
you know they need to make a living (sw4138B_0019)
so i think for for for many years we pay teachers and police officers and firemen who are  to a great extent public servants (sw4138B_0022)
not pay them really what they're worse than what they contribute to society (sw4138B_0023)
but  then again  it's hard to justify with all the wasteful news of money that the government spends on all levels of of  government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments (sw4138B_0026)
you're very fortunate (sw4138B_0037)
we just try not to pay any more and then we have to (sw4138B_0042)
we pay in a substantial amount (sw4138B_0043)
will regret paying taxes (sw4138B_0046)
we do think that  sometimes  we have a reverse of a regret attack say progressive tax (sw4138B_0047)
and progressive tax i think  does not give people incentive to make more money (sw4138B_0049)
and what i mean by that more income you make the more tax you pay (sw4138B_0050)
it should be i think a five percentage (sw4138B_0052)
and  that percentage out to be an equitable amounts (sw4138B_0053)
 last year when they passed the tax laws for the  nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one i i ended up all the taxes that we're going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else (sw4138B_0056)
and i told them all up (sw4138B_0059)
and basically  we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax (sw4138B_0060)
now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's a taxes on different things (sw4138B_0062)
but you know there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying that like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax (sw4138B_0065)
you pay gasoline taxes everytime you pump something into your tank (sw4138B_0068)
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other attacks (sw4138B_0073)
if you're under the influence of flap percentage of encourage people to make more money (sw4138B_0080)
and the people need to understand that my opinion of this is just my opinion okay  is that businesses create jobs and jobs creating common income pays taxes (sw4138B_0081)
and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point (sw4138B_0083)
i'm not going to working harder and make more or creating more jobs (sw4138B_0084)
and so (sw4138B_0088)
based on that who do you think you're talking to (sw4138B_0089)
you're talking to an employer (sw4138B_0090)
okay (sw4148A_0002)
so  but the issue of trial by jury  i actually found my whole question about whether you need a a you know a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting (sw4148A_0003)
i don't know if it's even through that it's always you know what i mean 'cause i thought there are cases where  i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve (sw4148A_0008)
yeah (sw4148A_0012)
well i'd be curious as to what the  requirement for right and i quit (sw4148A_0018)
and i i don't think it would be wrong to save at eleven out of twelve can convict if there was something corresponding saying that if you know six or seven voted not guilty but instead of it being a hung jury that was an aquarium (sw4148A_0019)
but i don't know whether you needed an unanimous  motive not guilty to  (sw4148A_0020)
yeah (sw4148A_0026)
agree with that (sw4148A_0027)
i've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury although i've been out here and registered for i guess about five years (sw4148A_0028)
yeah (sw4148A_0031)
the people i know of surface as it usually what ends up happening is that you know after initially finding out where people stand at the whole deliberation usually results if there is a you know something like a nine three or four more severe and and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they are right (sw4148A_0042)
and in fact i'm not sure that that's any more  liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than than anything else (sw4148A_0044)
read one book i think it was called trial by nature of all things but  went through an interviewed a bunch of jurors and some of the big cases and in many cases looking at what at  at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right went back to the jurors  based on deliberation (sw4148A_0050)
some of them did say that you know when they were the only one left opposing the verdict  you know everyone was getting on them so so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict (sw4148A_0053)
yeah (sw4148A_0060)
once (sw4148A_0061)
hi (sw4148B_0001)
yeah (sw4148B_0004)
actually i i agree that that's an interesting thing (sw4148B_0005)
i i believe that say for for civil suits it's not unanimous (sw4148B_0006)
but for for criminals suits it's unanimous by federal law (sw4148B_0007)
yeah (sw4148B_0009)
i actually thought i'd read that too (sw4148B_0010)
and that's why i phrased it that way (sw4148B_0011)
i wonder if (sw4148B_0013)
the difference yeah the difference could be that for  state if there is such a thing stay felonies versus federal that federal things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous though (sw4148B_0014)
things that aren't are state jurisdiction even criminal don't require (sw4148B_0015)
but i don't know what the the laws (sw4148B_0016)
think that that's an unreasonable  requirement that they'd be unanimous (sw4148B_0017)
yeah (sw4148B_0021)
that would be an interesting change (sw4148B_0022)
would also allow the  idea that if you had one person who was  very disagreeable that (sw4148B_0023)
i mean it it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because  the fact that it's well the the principal is it the fact that it's unanimous ensures that beyond a reasonable doubt  criterion that it  increases the the likelihood of getting the proper judgement (sw4148B_0024)
so i i think if anything i would have to be a very close to unanimous decision (sw4148B_0025)
yeah (sw4148B_0029)
actually i've i've thought that that would be a very interesting thing to do (sw4148B_0030)
i would like to do that (sw4148B_0032)
i've been out here twenty some years (sw4148B_0033)
and i've been called  three different times (sw4148B_0034)
but i've never actually even made it into the the jury box and 'cause they're always been a number of people (sw4148B_0035)
and and i've never gotten up there to answer any questions (sw4148B_0037)
 i (sw4148B_0038)
i also think that would be really good (sw4148B_0040)
the one thing that i know does seem to happen from people i've talked to on this is then in the situation you just said where it's nine to three or some such a number that there's an effect starts being that there's a lot of peer pressure going on (sw4148B_0045)
and that that  peer pressure (sw4148B_0047)
in some cases if it's a long trial the desire people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons (sw4148B_0048)
yeah (sw4148B_0054)
i understand (sw4148B_0055)
you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral forwarded to  to hold out if you believe that that was really the proper response (sw4148B_0056)
i think of the movie  twelve angry men (sw4148B_0057)
you ever seen that movie (sw4148B_0059)
yeah (sw4148B_0062)
it's it's exactly that situation where  (sw4148B_0063)
it's (sw4148B_0064)
it's a loving to one (sw4148B_0065)
and he's the one (sw4148B_0066)
i believe he was opposed to the conviction (sw4148B_0067)
and  and he held on (sw4148B_0068)
yeah (sw4148B_0069)
i guess we gotta talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if  if that may be the case in any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that (sw4149A_0001)
let me ask you the question (sw4149A_0003)
do you have a a budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to (sw4149A_0004)
uh-huh (sw4149A_0009)
i see (sw4149A_0015)
i see (sw4149A_0016)
 good (sw4149A_0017)
i'm kind of in a different situation (sw4149A_0018)
but i i went through that too when i was in school (sw4149A_0019)
 i was i was working to get through college and and  trying to make it through that (sw4149A_0020)
but  i'm married and have a couple of children (sw4149A_0021)
we have to  pretty much stick to a budget (sw4149A_0022)
i'm on a salary (sw4149A_0024)
so i don't get any overtime or anything like that (sw4149A_0025)
we have a fixed income (sw4149A_0026)
and we have to make sure that  every dollar we have is is spent forty (sw4149A_0028)
and  what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is that we pretty much have you know the house payment (sw4149A_0029)
we have the insurance premium  utilities and so forth (sw4149A_0031)
me to sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and ride down how much we know we're going to stand and set that money style (sw4149A_0032)
and we also find set aside money for saving satisfied money for the the kids' education college education teacher and  set aside money for bombs (sw4149A_0033)
in a way out to set aside an emergency (sw4149A_0035)
we've  we've been married for about ten years (sw4149A_0036)
and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair something happened with a house that you have to have money for and  not enough to go into to take a loan out but  you had to have money for (sw4149A_0038)
and  then we have (sw4149A_0041)
whatever's leftovers disposable aunt disposable this yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of them (sw4149A_0042)
so and it's worked out very well (sw4149A_0043)
it's  it's helped us so that we haven't been you know two long on a month to short on the money (sw4149A_0044)
 trying to stick with that (sw4149A_0045)
nice thing about it i  my wife is is excellent and (sw4149A_0047)
we both work together (sw4149A_0048)
we both have a budget (sw4149A_0049)
we stick to it (sw4149A_0050)
and there's no surprises and (sw4149A_0052)
i have four kids (sw4149A_0054)
yeah (sw4149A_0056)

yes (sw4149A_0101)
right (sw4149A_0103)
sometimes i've long and hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you gotta work on (sw4149A_0105)

you're not a starving artist yet are you (sw4149A_0111)
well good (sw4149A_0117)

but  once again (sw4149A_0142)
right (sw4149B_0002)
right now i'm in college (sw4149B_0005)
and i'm going to work study (sw4149B_0006)
so my budget comes from my dad's help (sw4149B_0008)
helps me out a lot (sw4149B_0010)
and i get paid monthly (sw4149B_0011)
so that's kinda hard to have a budget (sw4149B_0012)
my mother  doesn't get paid much money (sw4149B_0013)
so her budget is  just  planning for i r a's (sw4149B_0014)
uh-huh (sw4149B_0023)
uh-huh (sw4149B_0030)
that sounds good (sw4149B_0037)
right (sw4149B_0039)
right (sw4149B_0040)
well that's good (sw4149B_0046)
well good (sw4149B_0051)
with two kids that could be hard (sw4149B_0053)
yeah (sw4149B_0055)
 my goodness (sw4149B_0061)
it's a little boys (sw4149B_0063)
 my goodness (sw4149B_0065)
it's just me and my sister (sw4149B_0067)
and my parents divorced three years ago (sw4149B_0069)
and  my sister got through college (sw4149B_0071)
but i was still in high school (sw4149B_0072)
and my mother they paid for a lot of my sister's college for all my parents were together (sw4149B_0073)
and then  before the divorce she had saved for my college (sw4149B_0075)
but  when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house (sw4149B_0077)
so now my dad's paying for all of my college (sw4149B_0079)
financial aid and scholarships (sw4149B_0082)
i'm a music major (sw4149B_0084)
so i have auditions coming up (sw4149B_0085)
i'm a sophomore (sw4149B_0088)
right (sw4149B_0091)
right (sw4149B_0092)
i'll probably have about two two and a half years left (sw4149B_0093)
 it sure is (sw4149B_0099)
i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks (sw4149B_0100)
and i don't spend over there (sw4149B_0102)
 sure (sw4149B_0106)
there's there's always meet at books to buy (sw4149B_0107)
 no (sw4149B_0112)
yeah (sw4149B_0114)
i don't plan on being a starving artist (sw4149B_0116)
that's why i'm in college (sw4149B_0118)
right (sw4149B_0120)
there's usually cause they're not real educated (sw4149B_0125)
they can't afford to have a really good job (sw4149B_0126)
disturbing ones (sw4149B_0128)
there's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough and you can make money (sw4149B_0131)
right (sw4149B_0136)
what did you major in (sw4149B_0137)
 good (sw4149B_0139)
you know plenty about planning a a budget (sw4149B_0140)
so many kids do you have (sw4150A_0004)
right (sw4150A_0007)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0011)
no (sw4150A_0014)
yeah (sw4150A_0016)
we've been married for two and a half years (sw4150A_0017)
we've been trying for about two years (sw4150A_0018)
but i love cats (sw4150A_0019)
hopefully (sw4150A_0021)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0026)
okay (sw4150A_0031)
she has three kids eleven nine and (sw4150A_0032)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0034)
right (sw4150A_0036)
okay (sw4150A_0038)
so it keeps you busy (sw4150A_0039)
do you have a lot of activities with your kids (sw4150A_0040)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0048)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0054)
so they're pretty good kids (sw4150A_0055)
yeah (sw4150A_0058)
well we had night well growing up (sw4150A_0059)
i guess i can talk about us (sw4150A_0060)
we had nine kids in our family (sw4150A_0061)
eight boys and one girl (sw4150A_0062)
but my dad  (sw4150A_0063)
yeah (sw4150A_0065)
the time that might we spent with her dad was (sw4150A_0066)
he owns his own business (sw4150A_0067)
so we worked with some most of the time (sw4150A_0068)
so that's how we spent most of the time with him (sw4150A_0069)
yeah (sw4150A_0071)
as the dead give away  (sw4150A_0073)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0077)
which (sw4150A_0081)
and i'm going to say my sister wasn't spoiled very much (sw4150A_0084)
but (sw4150A_0089)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0091)
yeah (sw4150A_0101)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0102)
yeah (sw4150A_0114)
it's like you said it's you know to each his own (sw4150A_0115)
i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home (sw4150A_0116)
and but (sw4150A_0117)
yeah (sw4150A_0123)
right (sw4150A_0130)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0136)
uh-huh (sw4150A_0138)
 that's good (sw4150A_0147)
sounds like you have a handle on it (sw4150A_0148)
 no (sw4150A_0150)
right now (sw4150A_0151)
well we just moved down here (sw4150A_0154)
we we used to live up in seattle for a couple of years (sw4150A_0155)
that's no problem here (sw4150A_0157)
yeah (sw4150A_0158)
we really liked it up (sw4150A_0159)
but (sw4150A_0160)
yeah (sw4150B_0002)
i think i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children (sw4150B_0005)
we have three children who are eleven nine and eight (sw4150B_0006)
so this is a big issue with that although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about (sw4150B_0008)
perhaps they are looking for parts to be said like daycare and quality time (sw4150B_0009)
uh-huh (sw4150B_0010)
anyway (sw4150B_0012)
you don't have children (sw4150B_0013)
that you're married (sw4150B_0015)
you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance (sw4150B_0022)
but actually i'm getting a call (sw4150B_0023)
i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting (sw4150B_0024)
cause i ask you to hold one minute (sw4150B_0025)
i'll be right there (sw4150B_0027)
just a moment (sw4150B_0028)
they're going to hit (sw4150B_0030)
hello (sw4150B_0033)
i'm so sorry (sw4150B_0035)
that was my daughter's brownie later tell me that there's a meeting tomorrow brownie meetings (sw4150B_0037)
so i don't want to i don't want us to be a unilateral conversation (sw4150B_0041)
yes (sw4150B_0042)
we do (sw4150B_0043)
both my husband and i work (sw4150B_0044)
and our children are six forth in third grade (sw4150B_0045)
and the school years are wonderful (sw4150B_0046)
just wonderful (sw4150B_0047)
the kids are real people (sw4150B_0049)
interesting (sw4150B_0050)
and they they have all their own activities (sw4150B_0051)
and  i think as parents we really enjoy 'em and in our own personal situation (sw4150B_0052)
children have not yet decided to rebel (sw4150B_0053)
i'm i'm sure that's coming though (sw4150B_0056)
but they're wonderful kids (sw4150B_0057)
eight boys and one girl (sw4150B_0064)
are you mormon (sw4150B_0070)
with the utah the large family (sw4150B_0072)
well we're catholic (sw4150B_0074)
came from a family of five (sw4150B_0075)
i had four brothers (sw4150B_0076)
only girl (sw4150B_0078)
and everyone always ask if the girl got spoiled (sw4150B_0080)
i never felt spoiled (sw4150B_0082)
i was like my toys were destroyed (sw4150B_0083)
yeah (sw4150B_0085)
usually does he fighting for survival (sw4150B_0086)
well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here  that i think  (sw4150B_0090)
i don't know (sw4150B_0092)
it's an interesting (sw4150B_0093)
i happened to  (sw4150B_0094)
i'm a pediatrician (sw4150B_0095)
my husband's a physician (sw4150B_0097)
so  i i teach me and i talked to parents about this a lot (sw4150B_0098)
children (sw4150B_0099)
and i i think working mothers are mothers who choose to work outside the home  need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they and decide what's best for them and their family (sw4150B_0100)
and i feel when my children very young i had jobs that helps me be flexible with my kids don't spend time with them and all that so i think (sw4150B_0103)
i've long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home (sw4150B_0104)
i really believe that (sw4150B_0106)
and it has  helped us too affords and things for children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particular at this age (sw4150B_0107)
and i think the kids are real secure and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female (sw4150B_0108)
i know it sounds like a rationalization (sw4150B_0110)
but it's i really true for our family (sw4150B_0111)
i think it's worked very well (sw4150B_0113)
the question (sw4150B_0118)
i think that's really the best (sw4150B_0119)
if if a woman is happy doing that (sw4150B_0120)
he put it quite that way (sw4150B_0122)
i was twenty nine when i had my first child (sw4150B_0124)
and  i would not have been real fulfilled (sw4150B_0125)
i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child (sw4150B_0126)
it's a wonderful wonderful to be a mother (sw4150B_0128)
but  i liked i liked the way i did it (sw4150B_0129)
i sort of where cats (sw4150B_0131)
very flexible hours (sw4150B_0132)
i nursed all three of our children today are at least a year (sw4150B_0133)
and i mean you can do that to spite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers (sw4150B_0134)
 and i think we chose very very carefully the  alternative situations that we had the net (sw4150B_0137)
some babysitting groups (sw4150B_0139)
i know it sounds like a rationalization (sw4150B_0140)
but i really do think sometimes they very early on around lots of other children (sw4150B_0141)
and they they learn to share (sw4150B_0142)
learn not necessarily be the center of attention (sw4150B_0143)
but at the same time we have to be sure they're secure (sw4150B_0144)
that helps (sw4150B_0146)
so so your wife does she work right now (sw4150B_0149)
that (sw4150B_0152)
they're still trying to dry out (sw4150B_0156)
ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore (sw4151A_0001)
of the statements made by people against the the death penalty  i i liked the statement made by a quota (sw4151A_0009)
i believe is (sw4151A_0010)
 he's he's governor of new york (sw4151A_0011)
but  he's  against the death penalty (sw4151A_0012)
but  he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurts or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife (sw4151A_0013)
and that's (sw4151A_0014)
but but even even in that in that   situation he would he would hope that there'll be people around him who would  keep them from doing doing this thing (sw4151A_0015)
right (sw4151A_0017)
exactly (sw4151A_0018)
yeah (sw4151A_0023)
see i don't think  decisions ever going to be made on on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do (sw4151A_0025)
are they reform we're we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together (sw4151A_0026)
or are they (sw4151A_0027)
is it a penal institutions (sw4151A_0028)
it does is it does on for punishment (sw4151A_0029)
the death penalty surely fits in well with the penal situation where you're trying to punish (sw4151A_0030)
 perhaps not in the manner that we do it (sw4151A_0031)
but but it it in in theory it fits in (sw4151A_0032)
in reform system in a reformed tori (sw4151A_0033)
if you if you put some of the deaths you obviously can't reform them (sw4151A_0034)
yeah (sw4151A_0036)
yeah (sw4151A_0043)
i don't think it's done (sw4151A_0044)
i don't think we run it as a deterrent (sw4151A_0045)
i mean people say that (sw4151A_0046)
but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse these hanging by their necks every once in a while (sw4151A_0047)
and if we really if it was really seriously going to be used as a deterrent i would think that they would be public (sw4151A_0049)
i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever see that (sw4151A_0050)
if someone ever (sw4151A_0051)
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards the life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or something i (sw4151A_0053)
i think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protesters out here at the you know (sw4151A_0054)
well that's a good question (sw4151B_0002)
 there would be a point there was a point where i would have said no that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed (sw4151B_0003)
but  since i've become a parent and since i've seen  things like jeffrey dahmer i really have to question that (sw4151B_0004)
i really  i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people (sw4151B_0005)
and  try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment (sw4151B_0007)
well it's a  it's a question of you or your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response (sw4151B_0016)
 and that was the thing that  killed do cock us back  four years ago when someone asked him a similar question (sw4151B_0019)
and he he thought for a second and gave  thoughtful well reason reply when  people want it to see if he was going to go for an emotion  got level reaction (sw4151B_0020)
i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that got level  you know whether it be a biblical force  you know we i for a night tooth for two so life for a night life type logic or just   some sort of anger at putting pete putting  murderers up in federal pans for the rest of their life  while we foot the bill (sw4151B_0022)
i think people are are working at that for more of a  a gut reaction than  a reason humane one (sw4151B_0024)
that's true (sw4151B_0035)
 the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent (sw4151B_0037)
and i really don't  agree with that (sw4151B_0038)
i don't think anyone who would commit a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well i was about to kill and dismembered this person (sw4151B_0039)
but who if they catch me they're going to kill me (sw4151B_0040)
so i better not do it (sw4151B_0041)
i just don't think that  that it works that way (sw4151B_0042)
well i i don't know if that would really work that way or not (sw4151B_0055)
 there's a whole lot of violence (sw4151B_0056)
 anyway i  i  (sw4152A_0001)
i did forgot to ask (sw4152A_0003)
what is your name (sw4152A_0004)
 you're in (sw4152A_0006)
uh-huh (sw4152A_0007)
 anyway i  (sw4152A_0008)
a lot of lot of interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to i'm talking about the subject tonight which is  i guess criminal court (sw4152A_0009)
yeah (sw4152A_0012)
and  one of which was  something something that's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town (sw4152A_0013)
and that is  and that is the exclusion of jurors because of our in spite of their race  (sw4152A_0014)
yeah (sw4152A_0016)
well the the  the the people that (sw4152A_0017)
the  the jury that's trying  the officers in that case is is an all white panel (sw4152A_0018)
and there's been a lot made in the local papers at that fact (sw4152A_0020)
they have (sw4152A_0024)
they have (sw4152A_0025)
they moved it up to the county north of here (sw4152A_0026)
 it's in ventura (sw4152A_0028)
and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously (sw4152A_0029)
and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because of that  that (sw4152A_0030)
yeah (sw4152A_0032)
was everywhere (sw4152A_0033)
so you know (sw4152A_0035)
i i think it would be very difficult to find someone find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known what was going on (sw4152A_0036)
exactly (sw4152A_0039)
you know  the you know (sw4152A_0040)
i i'm kinda torn on this issue (sw4152A_0041)
it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true (sw4152A_0042)
but on the other hand is it's also say that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict (sw4152A_0043)
 you know they're not going to do their job which is (sw4152A_0045)
the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough (sw4152A_0046)
yeah (sw4152A_0056)
well i guess it depends on who you talk to (sw4152A_0057)
i haven't talked to a i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people (sw4152A_0058)
i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usual fatalistic  here we go again folks kinda stuff (sw4152A_0059)
no (sw4152A_0063)
no (sw4152A_0064)
you know (sw4152A_0065)
on on on one hand you're on the one hand you almost hope that they can attack them because it's they they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people being the heck out of this guy (sw4152A_0066)
uh-huh (sw4152A_0071)
uh-huh (sw4152A_0073)
yeah (sw4152A_0075)
i don't know you know (sw4152A_0080)
and and again there's something else they you know there was a  something else along those lines (sw4152A_0081)
there was a girl out here name tasha harlem (sw4152A_0082)
i don't know if this is scott scott as much notoriety (sw4152A_0083)
but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was it was it was with the rodney king probably (sw4152A_0084)
 girl walked into a korean own store (sw4152A_0085)
and  they she had a dispute black girl (sw4152A_0086)
she she had some kind of dispute over some orange juice with  with the owner of the story (sw4152A_0088)
the owner of the star pop (sw4152A_0089)
yeah (sw4152A_0091)
and and well of course they (sw4152A_0092)
criminal case went up (sw4152A_0093)
and and the judge caves a woman who shot shot the girl i   practically a suspended sentence (sw4152A_0094)
and it was it was just (sw4152A_0095)
she gave her no time in jail you know all of these things (sw4152A_0097)
and now there's we have these people wandering around with petitions trying to get the judge (sw4152A_0098)
yeah (sw4152A_0100)
yeah (sw4152A_0101)
yeah (sw4152A_0104)
it would make it would make life easier (sw4152A_0105)
yeah (sw4152A_0107)
but (sw4152A_0109)
hi i'm anne (sw4152B_0005)
criminal court (sw4152B_0010)
yeah (sw4152B_0011)
 really yeah well the (sw4152B_0015)
right (sw4152B_0019)
 that's (sw4152B_0021)
i can't (sw4152B_0022)
a little surprised i didn't get a change of venue (sw4152B_0023)
 that videotape was just horrible (sw4152B_0031)
yeah (sw4152B_0034)
 i agree with you (sw4152B_0037)
but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jerry without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know  appeal on not having a jury of peers and all of that kinda stuff (sw4152B_0038)
right (sw4152B_0044)
exactly (sw4152B_0047)
based on fact (sw4152B_0048)
right (sw4152B_0049)
how interesting (sw4152B_0050)
so what's the prevailing thought within the community (sw4152B_0052)
i mean you know what the news media is going to make of it (sw4152B_0054)
but what about the community (sw4152B_0055)
uh-huh (sw4152B_0060)
 my goodness (sw4152B_0061)
that can't be good for los angeles either (sw4152B_0062)
 exactly (sw4152B_0068)
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like los angeles (sw4152B_0069)
you're going to have it just about anywhere (sw4152B_0070)
yeah (sw4152B_0072)
but that's that's interesting (sw4152B_0074)
what about the judge his hearing the case (sw4152B_0077)
is he going to be impartial (sw4152B_0078)
you're going to get a good a jew decatur (sw4152B_0079)
uh-huh (sw4152B_0087)
 really (sw4152B_0090)
 my goodness (sw4152B_0096)
i guess that judge recalled i would think (sw4152B_0099)
that's almost when you kinda wish that there were some standardized sentences (sw4152B_0103)
it was (sw4152B_0106)
 you wouldn't know the whole world would know what you were facing (sw4152B_0110)
and then it's a matter of i've decided (sw4152B_0111)
okay (sw4153A_0001)
well  i used to work in a daycare center (sw4153A_0002)
i worked in  in all the different areas of the day care center (sw4153A_0004)
and it is they can be deceiving to people (sw4153A_0005)
and not worked along because i couldn't handle the treatment that the children (sw4153A_0006)
and this was supposed to be very well known center here in tyler who had two or three  centers all over you know the  city (sw4153A_0007)
and they would  be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left (sw4153A_0009)
so  i think you need to make you know if you do do daycare centers you know you should make frequent checks and  to check in on them when they're not expecting it (sw4153A_0011)
because they do do things differently when you're not around (sw4153A_0013)
so (sw4153A_0014)
right (sw4153A_0019)
this one was set up good (sw4153A_0029)
they had to teachers to every room  sometimes three (sw4153A_0030)
and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool (sw4153A_0032)
the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough (sw4153A_0034)
they did not show them care to these small children who are being left (sw4153A_0035)
 they (sw4153A_0037)
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying (sw4153A_0038)
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other (sw4153A_0039)
you are going to have every child in who want you to pick them up (sw4153A_0041)
and i said no (sw4153A_0042)
child was crying and needed some comfort (sw4153A_0043)
what is your problem (sw4153A_0045)
so  (sw4153A_0046)
yes (sw4153A_0048)
they did (sw4153A_0051)
they had like  the the callers the babies that didn't walk in one room and the ones that were starting to walk in one room (sw4153A_0052)
and they had like the  three three year olds upper fours lower lower five you know just like that (sw4153A_0054)
they really did separate them well (sw4153A_0056)
it was just the teachers themselves (sw4153A_0059)
right (sw4153A_0061)
yea (sw4153A_0063)
they're not (sw4153A_0064)
this is dumb (sw4153A_0066)
right (sw4153A_0067)
that they're that they're system was great (sw4153A_0068)
but  the you know the caring just wasn't there (sw4153A_0069)
the one woman that taught that did the babies i worked with her (sw4153A_0071)
and she was fabulous (sw4153A_0072)
she loves him babies (sw4153A_0074)
she loved 'em and care for (sw4153A_0075)
but  every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and  you know would make me a nervous wreck (sw4153A_0076)
you know (sw4153A_0077)
these kids are just in a daycare center all day and  with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care (sw4153A_0082)
they're just they're you know going through this routine which is lousy (sw4153A_0084)
uh-huh (sw4153A_0097)
you don't see that much (sw4153A_0100)
yeah (sw4153A_0105)
yeah (sw4153A_0109)
but it has to be with a bigger than (sw4153A_0110)
i've never heard of that (sw4153A_0113)
that's that's new and on me (sw4153A_0114)
uh-huh (sw4153B_0003)
yeah (sw4153B_0010)
hello (sw4153B_0015)
i know (sw4153B_0016)
the things that we've kind of looked at is is you want to see how many teachers you have and and how many kids they have and how they break it up (sw4153B_0017)
because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in (sw4153B_0020)
there was a really good one (sw4153B_0022)
and in fact it worked out for us 'cause my wife we've kind of barter (sw4153B_0023)
my wife did artwork forum (sw4153B_0024)
man you know so we got our  daycare free (sw4153B_0025)
but they didn't have enough teachers (sw4153B_0027)
and (sw4153B_0028)
uh-huh (sw4153B_0031)
yeah (sw4153B_0044)
did they separate 'em by age group (sw4153B_0047)
cause i think you know i think that's one thing that was important (sw4153B_0049)
uh-huh (sw4153B_0053)
it's (sw4153B_0057)
yeah (sw4153B_0058)
sounds like your your concern would be to make sure that they're loving people no affection and people that they're they're kind of parrot maybe parents themselves or something (sw4153B_0060)
i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates in p h d's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff (sw4153B_0079)
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good (sw4153B_0080)
yeah (sw4153B_0085)
the other the other group that we had it was kind of interesting (sw4153B_0087)
another one we went to that it was a husband and wife team (sw4153B_0088)
and we knew them from other associations (sw4153B_0090)
but  it was kind of interesting because she was kind of a district (sw4153B_0091)
i think you know she would she put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff and you know (sw4153B_0092)
but he was actually the more  the more  demonstrative type the more loving (sw4153B_0093)
he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids (sw4153B_0095)
and it it was kind of interesting to see the the that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it (sw4153B_0096)
yeah (sw4153B_0101)
so they had a really nice balance (sw4153B_0102)
we liked that one (sw4153B_0103)
in fact it was called hump they dumped the play school or something (sw4153B_0104)
but they also did they also did some of the teaching things (sw4153B_0106)
and then they had  (sw4153B_0107)
obedient obedience was important (sw4153B_0108)
and you know so they you know they use   i think they use (sw4153B_0111)
you've probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself (sw4153B_0112)
it's it's it's one (sw4153B_0115)
i can't remember what they call it exactly (sw4153B_0116)
but you're you're just standing in front of the clock (sw4153B_0117)
you know it has the second hand that goes around (sw4153B_0118)
and they have to stand (sw4153B_0120)
